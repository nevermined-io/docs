# 🧠 Nevermined Protocol v2.0

> The decentralized AI payments protocol for human-to-agent and agent-to-agent economies.

---

## 🚀 Motivation

AI-native commerce is inevitable—but current infrastructure isn't built for AI agents to transact autonomously. Traditional payment systems are designed for humans, not machine-to-machine economies.

**Nevermined** is the payment and access protocol built for:
- Autonomous AI agents
- Seamless crypto + fiat transactions
- Metered billing and usage-based payments
- Transparent, decentralized settlements

---

## 🔧 What Nevermined Does

Nevermined allows AI Builders to ship agents that can:

- 🔁 **Make and receive payments** (fiat via Stripe or crypto)
- 🧾 **Define flexible subscription/payment plans**
- 🔐 **Control access** to agents for paying users only
- 📊 **Track and meter usage dynamically**
- ⚡ **Instantly settle transactions**
- 💼 **Auto-account** for revenue, fees, and margins
- 🤖 **Enable AI-to-AI interactions**, not just human-to-AI

---

## 🛠 How It Works

### 📅 Payment Plans
Builders create configurable plans with:
- Payment type: crypto (ERC20/native) or fiat
- Subscription model: time-based or usage-based (credits)
- Pricing logic: fixed or dynamic per request
- Revenue split across multiple recipients

### 🤖 AI Agents
Each agent includes:
- Public metadata (query method, pricing)
- One or many attached plans
- A unique identifier (DID)

### 🔁 Interaction Models

#### 1. Direct Integration
- Subscriber sends `prompt + proof-of-request`
- Agent verifies and calls Nevermined to redeem credits

#### 2. Proxy Integration
- Unmodified agent behind the NVM Proxy
- Proxy handles request validation, proof generation, and credit redemption

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

Applications:   | Marketplaces | AI Agents | AI Apps
Services:       | Nevermined API | NVM Proxy
Smart Contracts:| Agents Registry | Plans | Credits (ERC-1155) | Agreements | Templates
Blockchain:     | EVM-compatible (Ethereum, Polygon, etc.)

- Libraries: Python, Typescript SDKs
- REST API and NVM Web App available

> See: `/docs/architecture-diagram.png` for visual overview

## 🔐 Smart Contracts

- Register payments and credit issuance
- Enforce access control
- Prevent overcharging via proof-of-request
- Open-source and under audit
- Roles managed via MultiSig governance

## 🆕 v2 vs v1 Improvements

| Feature | v1 | v2 |
|--------|----|----|
| Core focus | Broad asset types | Payments, access, accounting |
| TXs | Multi-step, off-chain node | Single on-chain transaction |
| Plans | Rigid | Fully customizable |
| Queries | Proxy only | Proxy + direct agent |
| Billing | Manual tracking | Proof-verified accounting |
| Governance | Account-based | MultiSig & upgradeable |

## 🆚 Compared to x402 (Coinbase)

| Feature | Nevermined | Coinbase x402 |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Protocol Type | Payments + Access | HTTP comms only |
| Payment Methods | Crypto + Fiat | Crypto only |
| Pricing Models | Time, usage, dynamic | Per-query only |
| Wallet Requirement | Optional | Required |
| Access Control | Native | Not included |
| Unified Settlement | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Facilitators | Built-in | Third-party |

> Strategy: NVM could support x402 *if real-world demand justifies it*

---

## 🧩 Partner Integration

Partners can offer Nevermined features natively using:
- `Partner ID` (public identifier)
- `Partner Secret` (auth token)

No need for redirects to the NVM App. API keys can be generated via embedded flows.

---

## 👥 Ecosystem Roles

### AI Builders
- Solo builders monetizing simple agents
- Multi-agent builders with interoperable swarms

### Subscribers
- Human users
- Other AI agents
- Apps or frontends
