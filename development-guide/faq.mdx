This page will answer some common questions about integrating Nevermined with your AI services.

## Integration FAQ

### Compatibility

#### Are the Nevermined Payment Libraries compatible with my AI agent?

The Nevermined Payment Libraries are designed to be compatible with any AI agent or service that can make HTTP requests. They can be used in both browser and server environments, making them suitable for a wide range of AI applications.

#### Can the Nevermined Payment Libraries be integrated with Google A2A or MCP?

Yes, the Nevermined Payment Libraries can be integrated with Google A2A, MCP, and other AI agent protocols.

For Google A2A, we built an adapted module of the libraries that can facilitate the integration. You can find a [sample implementation](https://github.com/nevermined-io/a2a-agent-client-sample) of how to use the Nevermined Payment Libraries with Google A2A.

For MCP, we are working on something pretty cool that will be ready soon. Promise\!

### Environments

#### Can I test my integration before going live?

Nevermined provides two separate environments:

- **Sandbox**: This is a testing environment where you can safely develop and test your integration. It makes real transactions but without any economic value.
- **Live**: This is the production environment where real transactions occur.

#### How can I change between "sandbox" and "live" environments?

- If you are using the [Nevermined App](https://nevermined.app), you can switch environments in the [Environment](https://nevermined.app/environment) section. Just click on the "Switch Environment" button to change between "sandbox" and "live".
- If you are using the Nevermined Payment Libraries, when you initialize the libraries you just need to set the `environment` parameter to either `sandbox` or `live`.

### Payments

#### What payment methods are supported?

Nevermined provides payments in both cryptocurrency and fiat:

- **Cryptocurrency**: Payments can be made using any ERC-20 token or via ETH.
- **Fiat**: Traditional payments methods (cards, transfers) are also supported via Stripe.

#### How can I configure different currencies when creating payment plans?

There are two ways, depending on whether you are using the Nevermined App or the Nevermined Payment Libraries:

- **Nevermined App**: When creating a payment plan, you can select the currency from a dropdown menu. If you want to receive payments in fiat, you must connect your Stripe account to the Nevermined App and select **USD**. If you want to receive payments in crypto, select **USDC**. Via the Nevermined App you can only create payment plans in **USD** or **USDC**.
- **Nevermined Payment Libraries**: When creating a payment plan using the libraries, you can specify whether the payment plan should be paid in fiat or crypto by setting the `priceType` attribute as `PlanPriceType.FIXED_FIAT_PRICE` for fiat or `PlanPriceType.FIXED_PRICE` for crypto payments. If you select `FIXED_PRICE`, in the `tokenAddress` attribute you can specify the address of the ERC-20 token you want to use for payments (i.e., USDC) or `ZeroAddress` if you want to use ETH.

#### How can I test payments in the "sandbox" environment?

If you want to test the payments functionality in the "sandbox" environment, you have two options depending on the payment method you want to use:

- **Crypto** You can use the [Circle USDC Faucet](https://faucet.circle.com/) to get some test USDC tokens. These tokens can be used to test payments in the "sandbox" environment.
- **Fiat**: You can use the [Stripe Test Cards](https://stripe.com/docs/testing#international-cards) to test payments in the "sandbox" environment. Just use any of the test cards provided by Stripe when making a payment. The payments will be processed as if they were real payments, but no actual money will be charged.
