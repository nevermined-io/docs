The Nevermined Payment Libraries are SDKs for programmatically integrating Nevermined payments into your application (create agents & plans, validate requests, and interact with the x402 flow).

This page is intentionally a lightweight hub. For method-by-method documentation, use the API Reference. For end-to-end integration examples, use the Quick Starts and framework guides.

## Notes

- The standalone SDK guides previously linked from here (TypeScript / Python) largely duplicate the API Reference pages and the Quick Starts.
- If you want, we can keep those pages on disk but de-emphasize them (current setup), or delete them entirely.
