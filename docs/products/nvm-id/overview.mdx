<Warning>
NVM ID documentation is under development. This section provides an overview based on current implementation details.
</Warning>

## What is NVM ID?

NVM ID is Nevermined's identity and access management system that handles authentication, authorization, and user management across the platform. It provides the security layer that ensures only authorized users can access AI services.

## Current Implementation

### API Key Authentication

Builders authenticate using Nevermined API keys:

```typescript
const payments = Payments.getInstance({
  nvmApiKey: process.env.NVM_API_KEY,
  environment: 'production'
})
```

### Bearer Token Access

Subscribers receive bearer tokens for API access:

```typescript
// Get access token after purchasing plan
const credentials = await payments.agents.getAgentAccessToken(
  planId,
  agentId
)

// Use token for authenticated requests
const response = await fetch(agentEndpoint, {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${credentials.accessToken}`
  }
})
```

    Builder->>NVM_ID: Authenticate with API Key
    NVM_ID-->>Builder: Session Token
    
    Subscriber->>NVM_ID: Purchase Plan
    NVM_ID-->>Subscriber: Access Token
    
    Subscriber->>Agent: Request with Bearer Token
    Agent->>NVM_ID: Validate Token
    NVM_ID-->>Agent: Token Valid + Plan Info

```

## Current Features

### For Builders
- API key generation and management
- Session management
- Usage analytics access

### For Subscribers

## Security Considerations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="API Key Security">
    - Store keys in environment variables
    - Rotate keys regularly
    - Never expose in client code
    - Use separate keys for dev/prod
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Token Management">
    - Tokens expire automatically
    - Refresh tokens not yet implemented
    - Validate on every request
    - Handle expiration gracefully
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Best Practices">
    - Use HTTPS for all requests
    - Implement request timeouts
    - Log security events
    - Monitor for anomalies
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Coming Soon

- Detailed API documentation
- User management dashboard
- Advanced authentication methods
- Compliance toolkit
- Enterprise features
