---

The Nevermined x402 Facilitator is a payment verification and settlement service that implements the x402 protocol standard. It enables AI agents to charge per-request using secure, locally-signed payment authorizations.

## What is x402?

The x402 protocol defines a payment-enforced HTTP flow:

1. Client calls an API endpoint
2. Server responds with **HTTP 402 Payment Required** and payment instructions
3. Client signs a payment authorization locally (private key never leaves device)
4. Signed authorization is included in the retry request
5. Server forwards it to the **Facilitator** for verification and settlement

## How It Works

    participant Client
    participant Agent as AI Agent
    participant Facilitator as x402 Facilitator
    participant Chain as Blockchain

    Client->>Agent: GET /resource
    Agent->>Client: 402 Payment Required + plan info

    Client->>Client: Sign payment authorization
    Client->>Agent: Request + PAYMENT-SIGNATURE header

    Agent->>Facilitator: /verify
    Facilitator->>Chain: Check balance & permissions
    Facilitator-->>Agent: Verification OK

    Agent->>Agent: Execute workload

    Agent->>Facilitator: /settle
    Facilitator->>Chain: Burn credits / execute payment
    Facilitator-->>Agent: Settlement OK + txHash

    Agent-->>Client: Response + receipt
```

## Facilitator Responsibilities

### Verification

The Facilitator validates incoming payment requests:

- x402 envelope structure and version
- EIP-712 signature authenticity
- Session key validity and permissions
- Subscriber balance and plan state
- UserOperation simulation

### Settlement

After the agent completes its work, the Facilitator:

- Executes `order` operations (auto top-up if needed)
- Executes `burn` operations (deduct credits)
- Submits UserOps on-chain
- Returns transaction hashes for transparency

## Nevermined's x402 Extensions

Standard x402 focuses on single ERC-20 pay-per-request flows. Nevermined extends this:

| Capability | Standard x402 | Nevermined x402 |
|------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Payment authorization | EIP-3009 | ERC-4337 UserOps + session keys |
| Wallet model | EOA signatures | Smart Accounts with permissions |
| Billing models | Pay-per-request | Subscriptions, credits, time-based |
| Delegated execution | Basic | Programmable burn, order, redeem |
| Settlement | ERC-20 transfer | Smart contract settlement |

## Permission Delegation

Subscribers can delegate specific permissions to agents via session keys:

| Permission | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `order` | Allow facilitator to auto-purchase credits |
| `redeem` | Allow facilitator to deduct credits per request |
| `burn` | Allow facilitator to burn usage units |
| `<custom>` | Additional session-key-scoped behaviors |
