Register your AI agents through the Nevermined App's visual interface. This guide walks through each step of the registration process.

## Prerequisites

- A Nevermined account (sign up at [nevermined.app](https://nevermined.app))
- Your AI agent's API endpoint(s) ready to receive requests
- Optional: OpenAPI spec, MCP manifest, or A2A agent card URL

## Registration Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Agents">
    From the Nevermined App dashboard, click **Agents** in the sidebar, then click **Register New Agent**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter Basic Information">
    Fill in your agent's metadata:

    | Field | Description | Example |
    |-------|-------------|---------|
    | **Name** | Display name for your agent | "Legal Document Analyzer" |
    | **Description** | What your agent does | "AI-powered legal document analysis and summarization" |
    | **Tags** | Categories for discovery | `legal`, `ai`, `documents` |
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure API Endpoints">
    Add the endpoints your agent exposes:

    - **HTTP Method**: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
    - **URL**: The full endpoint URL (e.g., `https://api.myservice.com/analyze`)
    - **Description**: What this endpoint does

    You can add multiple endpoints for a single agent.

    <Note>
      Your endpoints must be publicly accessible. Nevermined will route requests to these URLs with the subscriber's access token.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Agent Definition (Optional)">
    Link to a machine-readable definition of your agent:

    | Type | URL Format |
    |------|------------|
    | **OpenAPI** | `https://api.myservice.com/openapi.json` |
    | **MCP Manifest** | `https://api.myservice.com/mcp.json` |
    | **A2A Agent Card** | `https://api.myservice.com/.well-known/agent.json` |

    This enables automatic discovery and integration with AI frameworks.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review and Register">
    Review your agent configuration and click **Register Agent**. Your agent will be assigned a unique ID (`did:nv:...`).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Agent Configuration Examples

### REST API Agent

For a standard REST API:

```
Name: Data Analysis API
Description: Statistical analysis and visualization service

Endpoints:
- POST https://api.dataservice.com/analyze
- GET https://api.dataservice.com/status/{job_id}
- GET https://api.dataservice.com/results/{job_id}

Definition URL: https://api.dataservice.com/openapi.json
```

### MCP Tool Agent

For an MCP-compatible agent:

```
Name: Code Review Assistant
Description: AI-powered code review and suggestions

Endpoints:
- POST https://mcp.codereviewer.com/review

Definition URL: https://mcp.codereviewer.com/mcp.json
```

### A2A Agent

For Google Agent-to-Agent compatible agents:

```
Name: Travel Booking Agent
Description: Autonomous travel planning and booking

Endpoints:
- POST https://a2a.travelbot.com/tasks

Definition URL: https://a2a.travelbot.com/.well-known/agent.json
```

## After Registration

Once your agent is registered, you can:

1. **Create Payment Plans**: Add pricing to your agent
2. **View Agent ID**: Copy your `did:nv:...` for SDK integration
3. **Monitor Activity**: Track queries and usage
4. **Edit Settings**: Update endpoints or metadata

## Managing Multiple Agents

The Agents tab shows all your registered agents:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Name** | Agent display name |
| **ID** | Unique identifier (did:nv:...) |
| **Plans** | Number of payment plans attached |
| **Queries** | Total requests received |
| **Status** | Active, Paused, or Pending |

Click any agent to view details, edit configuration, or create payment plans.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use Descriptive Names" icon="tag">
    Choose names that clearly describe what your agent does. This helps subscribers find and understand your service.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Document Your Endpoints" icon="book">
    Provide clear descriptions for each endpoint. Include expected inputs, outputs, and any rate limits.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Include Agent Definition" icon="link">
    Link to an OpenAPI spec, MCP manifest, or A2A card. This enables automatic integration with AI frameworks and improves discoverability.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use HTTPS" icon="lock">
    All endpoints should use HTTPS for secure communication. HTTP endpoints are not supported.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Endpoint not reachable" icon="circle-exclamation">
    Verify your endpoint URL is correct and publicly accessible. Test with `curl` or a similar tool.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Registration fails" icon="circle-xmark">
    Check that all required fields are filled and your endpoint URLs are valid HTTPS URLs.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Agent not appearing" icon="eye-slash">
    Refresh the Agents page. New agents may take a few seconds to appear.
