## Plan Types in Detail

### Credits-Based Plans

Charge per usage - subscribers buy credits that are deducted with each request.

**Example Configuration**:
```
Name: Pro Plan
Price: 10 USDC
Credits: 100
Credits per Request: 1

→ $0.10 per query
```

**Use When**:
- Each request has similar cost
- You want pay-as-you-go pricing
- Usage varies significantly between users

### Time-Based Plans

Subscription model - unlimited access for a fixed duration.

**Example Configuration**:
```
Name: Monthly Subscription
Price: 50 USDC
Duration: 30 days

→ Unlimited queries for one month
```

**Use When**:
- Users need continuous access
- Usage is predictable
- You want recurring revenue

### Dynamic Plans

Variable pricing - charge different amounts based on request complexity.

**Example Configuration**:
```
Name: Pay As You Go
Price: 20 USDC (for 100 credits)
Min Credits per Request: 1
Max Credits per Request: 10

→ Simple queries: 1 credit
→ Complex queries: up to 10 credits
```

**Use When**:
- Requests have varying costs (e.g., LLM token count)
- You want fair usage-based pricing
- Processing time varies significantly

## Multiple Plans Per Agent

Create tiers to serve different customer segments:

```
Agent: Legal Document Analyzer

Plans:
1. Free Trial (0 USDC, 5 credits)
2. Starter ($5, 25 credits)
3. Pro ($15, 100 credits)
4. Enterprise ($99, 1000 credits)
```

<Note>
Subscribers can purchase multiple plans or repurchase to add more credits.
</Note>

## Editing Plans

From the Plans tab or agent detail page:

1. Click on the plan you want to edit
2. Modify settings (name, description, pricing)
3. Click **Save Changes**

<Warning>
Changing plan pricing affects new purchases only. Existing subscribers keep their original terms.
</Warning>

## Plan Analytics

Track each plan's performance:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Purchases** | Total times the plan was ordered |
| **Revenue** | Total earnings from this plan |
| **Active Subscribers** | Users with remaining credits/time |
| **Usage Rate** | Average credits used per subscriber |

## Free Trial Plans

Attract new users with free trials:

1. Create a new plan with **Price: 0**
2. Set limited credits (e.g., 5 queries)
3. Name it clearly (e.g., "Free Trial - 5 Queries")

Users can claim the trial once per account, then must purchase a paid plan.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Offer Multiple Tiers" icon="layer-group">
    Create at least 3 tiers (e.g., Starter, Pro, Enterprise) to capture different customer segments and budgets.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Include a Free Trial" icon="gift">
    Let users try before they buy. A small free trial (5-10 credits) can significantly increase conversions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Price for Value" icon="dollar-sign">
    Consider the value your agent provides, not just your costs. Premium AI services can command premium prices.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Clear Descriptions" icon="align-left">
    Explain exactly what subscribers get. Include credits, duration, and any limitations.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
