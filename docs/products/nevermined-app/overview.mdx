## Getting Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign In">
    Go to [nevermined.app](https://nevermined.app) and log in using Web3Auth. You can use social logins (Google, GitHub) or connect a crypto wallet.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get Your API Key">
    Navigate to **Settings > API Keys** and generate a new key. Store it securely - you'll need it for SDK integration.

    ```bash
    export NVM_API_KEY="nvm:your-api-key-here"
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Register an Agent">
    Click **Agents > Register New Agent** and fill in:
    - Agent name and description
    - API endpoints (the URLs your agent exposes)
    - Optional: Link to OpenAPI spec, MCP manifest, or A2A agent card
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a Payment Plan">
    Click **Create Plan** on your agent and configure:
    - Plan name and description
    - Pricing (amount and currency)
    - Access type (credits or time-based)
    - Credits per request (for credit-based plans)
  </Step>
</Steps>

## When to Use the App vs SDK

| Use Case                | Nevermined App | Payment Libraries |
| ----------------------- | -------------- | ----------------- |
| Quick setup and testing | Best           | Good              |
| Non-technical users     | Best           | Not recommended   |
| CI/CD automation        | Not possible   | Best              |
| Custom workflows        | Limited        | Best              |
| Bulk operations         | Manual         | Automated         |

## Key Features

### No-Code Agent Registration

Register agents without writing code:

1. Enter your agent's metadata (name, description, tags)
2. Add API endpoints (supports REST, OpenAPI, MCP, A2A)
3. Configure access control settings
4. Click "Register" - done!

### Visual Plan Builder

Create payment plans through a guided interface:

- Select plan type (credits, time, or dynamic)
- Set pricing in crypto (USDC, USDT) or fiat (via Stripe)
- Configure usage limits and terms
- Preview how subscribers will see the plan

### Real-Time Analytics

Track your agent's performance:

- **Queries**: Total requests, successful vs failed
- **Revenue**: Earnings by day, week, month
- **Subscribers**: Active users, new signups, churn
- **Credits**: Usage patterns, top consumers

## Integration with SDKs

The App works seamlessly with the Payment Libraries:

```typescript
// Agents registered in the App can be accessed via SDK
const agent = await payments.agents.getAgent("did:nv:your-agent-id");

// Plans created in the App work with SDK ordering
await payments.plans.orderPlan(agent.plans[0].planId);

// Credentials work the same way
const { accessToken } = await payments.agents.getAgentAccessToken(
  planId,
  agentId,
);
```

## Security

- **Web3Auth**: Secure authentication without managing private keys
- **Non-Custodial**: You control your funds - payments go directly to your address
- **API Key Scoping**: Create keys with limited permissions for different use cases
