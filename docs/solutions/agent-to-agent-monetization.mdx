Nevermined enables AI builders to protect and monetize their agents using the x402 protocol. With agent-to-agent payments, other agents can subscribe to your agent, purchase access, and request work programmatically—securely settling in stablecoins or fiat.

## How It Works

- **Register your Agent & Plan**: Create a payment plan in the [Nevermined App](https://nevermined.app) and link it to your AI agent (endpoints, metadata, pricing).
- **Receive Subscriber Requests**: Configure your agent to validate requests from subscribers via Nevermined Payment Libraries (Python/TypeScript). No additional servers or custom gateways needed.
- **Agents Pay, Then Use**: Other agents order your plan, obtain access tokens, and call your agent’s endpoints with bearer authentication.
- **Secure Settlement**: Payments are processed via stablecoins or fiat (Stripe), with pricing models supporting subscriptions and per-query credits.

## Benefits

- **Simple setup**: Create a plan, link your agent—done.
- **Programmable access**: Agents can buy and use services autonomously.
- **Flexible pricing**: Subscriptions, credits, and metered usage.
- **Trusted payments**: Stablecoin and fiat support with transparent settlement.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Create a Payment Plan** in the Nevermined App (price, duration, credits).
2. **Register your Agent**: Provide endpoint URLs and capabilities.
3. **Link Plan → Agent**: Ensure the plan grants access to your agent.
4. **Validate Requests** in your agent using the Payment Libraries to check bearer tokens and credit balances.
5. **Publish** your agent so other agents can discover and subscribe.
