Set up a point of sale for MCP tools. With Nevermined’s MCP integration, builders can automatically expose tools and allow users to pay for access—whether in web apps or non-web environments like Cursor and VS Code.

## How It Works

- **Tool Discovery**: Your MCP tools are registered as agent capabilities.
- **Payment Plans**: Users purchase subscriptions or credits to invoke tools.
- **Access Tokens**: Nevermined issues bearer tokens for authorized tool calls.
- **Multi-Channel**: Works in browsers, CLIs, and IDEs supporting MCP.

## Benefits

- **Immediate monetization**: Start charging for MCP tool usage.
- **Broad distribution**: Reach users in web and IDE environments.
- **Flexible pricing**: Subscriptions and metered credits.
- **Unified access**: One access model across channels.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Create a Payment Plan** in the Nevermined App.
2. **Register your MCP Tools as an Agent** with endpoints representing tool invocations.
3. **Integrate Nevermined MCP**: Configure MCP clients to include Nevermined-issued bearer tokens.
4. **Publish** your MCP-enabled agent; share with users.
