Nevermined provides end-to-end observability for your AI agents. Track incoming requests, measure credit redemption, and monitor revenue to understand how your services are used and optimize performance.

## How It Works

- **Request Tracking**: Each call is validated and logged (success/failure, credits used, caller identity).
- **Usage Metrics**: Monitor per-agent and per-plan usage, remaining balances, and redemption history.
- **Revenue Analytics**: See plan purchases, settlements, and trends.

## Benefits

- **Operational visibility**: Clear overview of traffic and usage.
- **Optimization**: Identify hot endpoints and improve performance.
- **Compliance & auditing**: Traceable records for paid access.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Enable Observability** via Payment Libraries configuration in your agent.
2. **Create Plans & Link Agents** to ensure paid calls are tracked.
3. **Monitor in the App**: Use dashboards to review usage and revenue.
4. **Export Data**: Pull metrics via API for custom dashboards.
