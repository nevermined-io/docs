Monetize static assets—like datasets, files, pre-trained models, or HTTP URLs without restructuring your infrastructure. Nevermined provides a transparent HTTP Proxy and access control, enabling you to define who can access which resources and under what conditions.

## How It Works

- **Transparent Proxy**: Requests pass through Nevermined’s proxy, which validates access tokens and credit balances before forwarding to your asset.
- **Payment Plans**: Offer subscriptions or credit-based plans priced in stablecoins or fiat.
- **Fine-Grained Access**: Control access per resource, route, or method; enforce rate limits and usage caps.

## Benefits

- **Minimal changes**: Keep your existing storage/API; add a proxy in front.
- **Secure access**: Bearer-token validation and metered usage.
- **Flexible payments**: Stablecoin and fiat support with configurable pricing.
- **Operational clarity**: Audit logs and usage metrics per resource.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Model your Resource as an Agent**: Register a resource-representing agent with endpoints/paths.
2. **Create a Payment Plan**: Choose subscription or credits and set pricing.
3. **Enable the HTTP Proxy**: Configure the proxy to protect your resource and validate incoming requests.
4. **Publish & Monitor**: Make the resource available; track usage and revenue in the App.
