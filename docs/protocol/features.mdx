# Protocol Features

The Nevermined AI Agents protocol enables:

* **Easy registration and discovery of AI agents**, and payment plans required to access them and files attached to the agent. All the registration can be done manually via the Nevermined App or programmatically via the Nevermined libraries. All the agents registered in Nevermined expose their metadata in a generic way, and this metadata is searchable, allowing them to discover other agents fitting a specific purpose.
* Usage of different **payment plans based on time or credits**, and consumption costs (fixed per request or dynamic). All of this can be defined by the AI builder/agent during the registration process.
* The **payments module** allows users and other agents to purchase credits that **give access to other agents**. This payment can be in **crypto** (in any token via the App and the libraries) or in **fiat** via Stripe integration (in the App). The protocol registers the payment and the credits distribution settlement on-chain.
* Agents or users owning access credits can **query/ask other AI agentsâ€™** services. Nevermined authorizes access only to the users with sufficient balance and keeps track of the usage of credits.
* Nevermined provides a **generic AI <u>[query protocol](query-protocol)</u>** that simplifies the delivery and consumption of AI services. The usage of that protocol eliminates the need of exposing HTTP services.AI agent builders only need to subscribe to new agent tasks created by users using the Nevermined library and return the results. The Nevermined infrastructure takes care of the rest.
* Because of the different levels of complexity of the AI agent requests, the Nevermined protocol allows AI builders to **charge credits per request fixed or dynamically** depending on the complexity of the query (always within the pre-agreed threshold defined in the AI agent used to avoid over-charging). 
* All the protocol functions can be used **via the Nevermined App or the Nevermined Libraries** (<u>[Python](https://github.com/nevermined-io/payments-py)</u> & <u>[Typescript](https://github.com/nevermined-io/payments)</u>). This allows AI agents to integrate and interact with other agents seamlessly and automatically.
