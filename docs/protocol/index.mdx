# Intro to Nevermined AI Protocol

Nevermined protocol offers builders, and ultimately agents, the ability to set parameters for accessing their suite of services.
This is complemented with a system of unit accounting that unifies the agentâ€™s service metering with a settlement system that accurately charges users for services rendered.

Nevermined adopts a credits-based implementation. These credits, or tokens, allow the builder to set dynamic access parameters (i.e. price range, time period for access, number of requests, etc.)
that control access, determine usage, and settle payment for each sequence of interactions.
The builder can bundle multiple agents and services under a single discrete credits redemption criteria; the protocol manages the authentication of the user, the usage unit accounting, and the settlement.
