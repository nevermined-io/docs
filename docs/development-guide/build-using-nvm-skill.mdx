Use the **Nevermined AI Skill** to give your coding assistant deep knowledge of the Nevermined Payments SDK, the x402 payment protocol, and integration patterns for Express.js, FastAPI, Strands agents, and MCP servers.

Instead of copy-pasting docs, you import the skill once and your AI assistant knows how to wire up payments for you.

## What's Included

The skill provides your coding assistant with:

- **SDK initialization** patterns for TypeScript and Python
- **Framework-specific middleware** (Express.js, FastAPI, Strands, MCP)
- **x402 protocol** flow — headers, verification, settlement
- **Payment plan** registration and configuration
- **Client-side** integration — ordering plans, generating tokens, calling protected APIs
- **Troubleshooting** for common errors (402, `-32003`, `-32002`)

## Import the Skill

### Claude Code

```bash
claude /install-skill https://github.com/nevermined-io/docs skills/nevermined-payments
```

After importing, Claude Code will automatically use the skill when you work on Nevermined integrations.

### Cursor

The Nevermined skill is automatically loaded when you open a project that includes the `.cursorrules` or `.cursor/rules/nevermined-payments.mdc` files. To add these to your own project:

1. Copy `.cursorrules` to your project root
2. Or copy `.cursor/rules/nevermined-payments.mdc` to your project's `.cursor/rules/` directory

### GitHub Copilot

Copy `.github/copilot-instructions.md` to your project's `.github/` directory. Copilot reads this file automatically for repository-specific context.

### ChatGPT / Other Assistants

Share the skill content directly:

1. Open the [`SKILL.md` file](https://github.com/nevermined-io/docs/blob/main/skills/nevermined-payments/SKILL.md)
2. Copy the contents
3. Paste into your assistant's context or knowledge base

## Example Prompts

After importing the skill, try prompts like:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Add payments to Express.js" icon="node-js">
    "Add Nevermined x402 payment protection to my Express.js API. I want to charge 1 credit per request on the `/ask` endpoint."
  </Card>

  <Card title="Protect a FastAPI endpoint" icon="python">
    "Integrate Nevermined payments into my FastAPI app. Use dynamic credits based on the token count in the response."
  </Card>

  <Card title="Build a paid MCP server" icon="laptop">
    "Create an MCP server with Nevermined payments. Register a weather tool that costs 5 credits per call."
  </Card>

  <Card title="Add payments to a Strands agent" icon="robot">
    "Protect my Strands agent tool with the @requires_payment decorator. Charge 2 credits per call."
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Alternative: Use the MCP Search Server

If you prefer real-time documentation search over a static skill, you can connect your coding assistant to the Nevermined MCP documentation server:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nevermined-docs": {
      "url": "https://docs.nevermined.app/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

This gives your assistant the ability to search the full Nevermined documentation on-demand. See [Build Using Nevermined MCP](/docs/development-guide/build-using-nvm-mcp) for details.

## Skill vs. MCP Server

| Approach | Best For | Tradeoff |
|---|---|---|
| **AI Skill** (SKILL.md) | Fast, offline-capable, consistent patterns | Static — you need to update when SDK changes |
| **MCP Search Server** | Always up-to-date, full doc coverage | Requires network, slower per-query |

For the best experience, use both: import the skill for core patterns and connect the MCP server for edge cases.
