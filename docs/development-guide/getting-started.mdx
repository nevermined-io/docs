This guide will help you set up and initialize the Nevermined Payment Libraries to start monetizing your AI services.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Development Environment">
    - Node.js 16+ and npm/yarn (for TypeScript)
    - Python 3.8+ (for Python)
    - A code editor (VS Code recommended)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Nevermined API Key">
    Get your API key from the [Nevermined App](https://nevermined.app)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Tokens (Optional)">
    Some test tokens for testing (you can [get some USDC from here](https://faucet.circle.com/))
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Installation

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="TypeScript/JavaScript">
    ```bash
    npm install @nevermined-io/payments
    # or
    yarn add @nevermined-io/payments
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Python">
    ```bash
    pip install payments-py
    ```

## Getting Your API Key

1. Go to the [Nevermined App](https://nevermined.app)
2. Log in with your credentials (email, Google account, or GitHub)
3. Navigate to the **API Keys** section in the left user menu
4. Click on the **New API Key** button at the top right of the page
5. Generate a new key, give it a descriptive name, and copy it
6. Store this key securely as an environment variable (e.g., `NVM_API_KEY`)

<Warning>
Never expose your API key in client-side code or commit it to version control. Always use environment variables.
</Warning>

## Initialize the Payments Libraries

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="TypeScript">
    ```typescript
    import { Payments } from '@nevermined-io/payments'
    
    const payments = Payments.getInstance({
      nvmApiKey: process.env.NVM_API_KEY,
      environment: 'sandbox' // or 'live'
    })
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Python">
    ```python
    from payments_py import Payments
    import os
    
    payments = Payments(
        api_key=os.environ.get('NVM_API_KEY'),
        environment='sandbox'  # or 'live'
    )
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Environment Configuration
