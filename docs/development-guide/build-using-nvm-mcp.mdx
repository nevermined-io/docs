<Note>
  You can use the Nevermined Docs MCP server to vibe-code applications directly
  from Claude Code, Open Code, Cursor, Continue, Zed, and other MCP-aware IDE
  copilots. Point any MCP-compatible client at the server URL below to stream
  up-to-date docs into your coding sessions.
</Note>

<Note>
**LLM Context Files for AI Assistants**

If you're using an AI assistant for development, you can provide comprehensive context files to streamline your integration:

- **Concise Context**: [https://nevermined.ai/docs/llms.txt](https://nevermined.ai/docs/llms.txt) - Quick reference with key concepts and examples
- **Full Context**: [https://nevermined.ai/docs/llms-full.txt](https://nevermined.ai/docs/llms-full.txt) - Complete documentation for in-depth integration work

Simply copy the contents and paste them into your LLM's input as a knowledge base.
</Note>

<Note>
**MCP Configuration File**

For quick setup with MCP-compatible IDEs, download our pre-configured MCP file:

- **Download**: [nevermined.mcp.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nevermined-io/docs_mintlify/main/files/nevermined.mcp.json) - Ready-to-use configuration for Cursor, Continue, Claude Desktop, and other MCP clients

Use this file as a reference or copy its contents into your IDE's MCP configuration.
</Note>

The Nevermined Docs MCP Server provides seamless access to all Nevermined's documentation directly within your AI development environment. By integrating this MCP server, you can build AI agents and applications with real-time access to Nevermined's payment SDKs and Libraries, API references, and development guides.

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables AI applications to securely connect to external data sources and tools. Think of MCP as a "USB-C for AI" - it provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different services, documentation, and APIs.

**Key Benefits:**

- 🔌 **Standardized Connections**: Connect any MCP-compatible AI client to our documentation
- 🔄 **Real-time Access**: Always up-to-date information from our docs
- 🛡️ **Secure Integration**: Built-in security and authentication
- 🌍 **Remote Access**: No local installation required

## MCP Server Details

**Nevermined Documentation MCP Server URL:** `https://docs.nevermined.app/mcp`

This server provides access to:

- Complete Nevermined API documentation
- Development guides and tutorials
- Code examples in Python and TypeScript
- Payment plan configuration guides
- AI agent registration workflows

### Instant Setup Commands

## Quick Setup for Vibe-Code Tools

Follow these lightweight steps to attach the Nevermined Docs MCP server to popular
code-native AI tools. Each tool simply needs the remote MCP endpoint
`https://docs.nevermined.app/mcp`.

<Tip>
**Quick Start**: Download the [nevermined.mcp.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nevermined-io/docs_mintlify/main/files/nevermined.mcp.json) configuration file and use it as a reference for your IDE's MCP setup. The file contains the complete configuration needed for most MCP-compatible tools.
</Tip>

### Claude Code (VS Code extension)

**One-Line Setup** (Recommended):

Run this command in your terminal for instant setup:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http --url https://docs.nevermined.app/mcp nevermined-docs
```

**Alternative - GUI Setup**:

1. Open the Command Palette and run "Claude: Open Settings"
2. In **Model Context Protocol** → **Custom Connectors**, click **Add**
3. Enter the server URL `https://docs.nevermined.app/mcp` and save
4. Start chatting; the Nevermined docs source appears under available connectors

### Cursor IDE

**One-Line Setup** (Recommended):

```bash
# Create or update Cursor MCP config
mkdir -p ~/.cursor && echo '{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nevermined-docs": {
      "url": "https://docs.nevermined.app/mcp",
      "type": "http"
    }
  }
}' > ~/.cursor/mcp.json
```

Then restart Cursor to activate the connection.

**Alternative Methods**:

1. **Using Configuration File**:
   - Download [nevermined.mcp.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nevermined-io/docs_mintlify/main/files/nevermined.mcp.json)
   - Copy contents to `~/.cursor/mcp.json`
   - Reload the IDE

2. **Manual GUI Setup**:
   - Open Settings → search for **MCP Servers**
   - Add remote server: `https://docs.nevermined.app/mcp`
   - Enable the connector in chat

### Open Code

**Quick Setup**:

Add to your MCP configuration:

```bash
# Add to your Open Code MCP settings
echo '{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nevermined-docs": {
      "url": "https://docs.nevermined.app/mcp",
      "type": "http"
    }
  }
}' >> ~/.opencode/mcp.json
```

Or manually add the server in Settings → **Model Context Protocol**

### Continue (VS Code / JetBrains)

**Quick Setup**:

Add to your Continue configuration (`~/.continue/config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": [
    {
      "name": "nevermined-docs",
      "url": "https://docs.nevermined.app/mcp",
      "transport": "http"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Or via Continue UI**:

1. Open Continue settings and locate **MCP / Tools**
2. Add MCP server: `nevermined-docs` → `https://docs.nevermined.app/mcp`
3. Reload Continue to activate

> If your IDE supports MCP but is not listed, add a remote MCP connector pointing to
> `https://docs.nevermined.app/mcp` and enable it for chat/code actions. The server
> requires no extra auth beyond your Nevermined API usage in code samples.

## Best Practices

When using the Nevermined MCP server, follow these best practices:

### Security Considerations

- **Verify Connections**: Always ensure you're connecting to the official Nevermined MCP server
- **Review Permissions**: Only grant necessary tool permissions in your MCP client
- **Secure API Keys**: Store Nevermined API keys securely and never expose them in client-side code

### Development Workflow

1. **Start with Documentation**: Use the MCP server to understand Nevermined concepts
2. **Test in Sandbox**: Always test your implementations in Nevermined's sandbox environment
3. **Iterate with Examples**: Use the provided code examples as starting points
4. **Monitor Usage**: Implement proper logging and monitoring for production deployments

### Performance Optimization

- **Cache Documentation**: Cache frequently accessed documentation locally when possible
- **Batch Requests**: Group related operations to minimize API calls
- **Implement Retries**: Add retry logic for transient failures
- **Monitor Limits**: Respect rate limits and implement backoff strategies

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Connection Failed

- Verify you're using the correct URL: `https://docs.nevermined.app/mcp`
- Check your internet connection
- Ensure your MCP client supports remote servers

#### Authentication Errors

- Verify your Nevermined API key is correctly configured
- Check that you're using the right environment (sandbox vs production)
- Ensure your API key has the necessary permissions

#### Documentation Not Loading

- Try refreshing the connection in your MCP client
- Check if the MCP server is accessible at: https://docs.nevermined.app/mcp
- Restart your MCP client if issues persist
