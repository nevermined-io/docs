Upgrade your account to an organization to unlock powerful monetization and revenue sharing capabilities. Make it easy for your builders to earn revenue and add access control to their agents. As an organization owner, you gain full control over your community's success and your branding.

## Benefits

### Upgrade to Organization

Transform your account into an organization to manage teams, share revenue, and customize the checkout page your clients use to purchase your plans. As an organization owner, you'll have full control over your team's success.

### Revenue Sharing

Set your own commission rate. When any builder in your organization sells a plan, you automatically receive your defined cut.

### Custom Checkout

Brand the checkout experience for all builders in your organization — add your logo, colors, and messaging to the page where clients buy your plans.

## How to Upgrade

The flow to upgrade your account is straightforward:

1. Go to your [Profile Page](https://nevermined.app/profile) and click the **Upgrade now** button.
2. You will be directed to the checkout flow, where you can subscribe to the Organization plan for **$50/month**.
3. After completing the payment, you will be redirected to the organizations page.
4. In the organizations page, you can:
   - Enter your Organization Name.
   - Set up crypto and fiat fees (your cut for every purchase made by your organization's members).
   - Customize the checkout appearance for your organization's members.

## Flow of Funds

When a builder within your organization sells a payment plan, the distribution of funds works as follows (specifically for fiat payments):

1. **Builder sells a payment plan**: A client purchases a plan from a builder in your organization.
2. **Fee Deduction**: The total value of the plan is calculated, and the following fees are deducted:
   - Nevermined Fees
   - Stripe Fees
   - **Organization Fees**: The commission rate set by the organization admin.
3. **Builder Payout**: The builder receives the remaining amount: `Plan Value - (Nevermined Fees + Stripe Fees + Organization Fees)`.
4. **Organization Disbursement**: Nevermined disburses the collected Organization Fees to the organization admin.
