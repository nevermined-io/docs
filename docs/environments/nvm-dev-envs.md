# Testnet environments

Testnet environments are public nevermined environments deployed on public EVM-compatible testnet networks. Typically we use Polygon Mumbai.
Use [Alchemy's Mumbai Faucet](https://mumbaifaucet.com/) or [Polygon's Mumbai faucet](https://faucet.polygon.technology/) for requesting MATIC.

## Network Fee

You need to pay a fee to use a Nevermined environment when a payment is being done through the Smart Contracts. This needs to be configured by the content publisher. You can find more information in the [Network Fees section](network-fees.mdx).

:::info

The network fee in Nevermined testnets is **1%** and the receiver of that fee is the **0x309039F6A4e876bE0a3FCA8c1e32292358D7f07c** address.
