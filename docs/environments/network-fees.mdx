# Network Fees

Nevermined provides the infrastructure to content creators and users to negotiate around their digital assets in a secure a trustless manner. All the software required to make that happen is available under an Open Source License. 

To continue to provide this service, the Nevermined Smart Contracts charge a **1 % fee** on all monetary transactions. This fee is included in the distribution of rewards, when an NFT is sold.

There is no minimum fee, so if the asset is traded for free, it's not necessary to factor in payment.

## How to setup the network fees?

To execute a transaction using the Nevermined Smart Contracts it is necessary to include a comission in the reward payment. This comission goes to the **Nevermined Fee Receiver**.

This typically can be done when a content creator defines how payments are distributed during asset registration.

```js

// Nevermined Fee receiver address in testnet environments
const nvmFeeReceiverTest = '0x309039F6A4e876bE0a3FCA8c1e32292358D7f07c'

// Nevermined Fee receiver address in production environments
const nvmFeeReceiverProd = '0x35aFA2408BB4f479996fafb2bB3A183ec064C265'

const assetPrice = new AssetPrice(
    new Map([
        [creatorAddress, nvmFeeReceiverProd],
        [198, 2] // 99% of the payment goes to the `creatorAddress` and 1% to `nvmFeeReceiverProd`
    ])
)

// We register a NFT-721 Asset using the payment distribution defined in the `assetRewards` variable
const nftAttributes = NFTAttributes.getNFT721Instance({
    metadata,
    price: assetPrice,
    serviceTypes: ['nft-sales', 'nft-access'],
    nftContractAddress: nftContract.address
})
ddo = await nevermined.nfts721.create(nftAttributes, creatorAddress)

```
