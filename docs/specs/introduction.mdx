---

This section contains the **technical specifications** that define how Nevermined protocol and extensions work. These documents are intended for developers building integrations, protocol implementers, and anyone who needs to understand the precise behavior of Nevermined systems.

## Purpose

Specifications in this section:

- **Define normative behavior** using precise, unambiguous language
- **Follow RFC 2119 conventions** for requirement levels (MUST, SHOULD, MAY)
- **Include data structures** with exact field definitions and types
- **Document protocol flows** with sequence diagrams and state transitions
- **Specify error handling** and edge cases

## Audience

These specifications are written for:

- **Protocol implementers** building x402 facilitators or clients
- **SDK developers** creating libraries that interact with Nevermined
- **Integration engineers** connecting existing systems to Nevermined
- **Security auditors** reviewing protocol designs

## Relationship to Other Documentation

| Documentation Type | Purpose |
|-------------------|---------|
| **Getting Started** | Quickstart guides and tutorials |
| **Use Cases** | Business scenarios and solution patterns |
| **Integration Guides** | Step-by-step implementation instructions |
| **API Reference** | SDK methods and REST endpoints |
| **Specifications** | Formal protocol definitions (this section) |

Specifications are the **source of truth** for protocol behavior. Other documentation may simplify or summarize, but specifications define what implementations MUST do.

## Conventions

### Requirement Levels

This documentation uses RFC 2119 terminology:

- **MUST** / **REQUIRED** / **SHALL** — absolute requirement
- **MUST NOT** / **SHALL NOT** — absolute prohibition
- **SHOULD** / **RECOMMENDED** — there may be valid reasons to ignore, but implications must be understood
- **SHOULD NOT** / **NOT RECOMMENDED** — there may be valid reasons to do this, but implications must be understood
- **MAY** / **OPTIONAL** — truly optional behavior

### Data Types

- JSON structures use TypeScript-style type annotations
- Hexadecimal values are prefixed with `0x`
- Base64 encoding uses standard alphabet with `=` padding
- Timestamps use ISO 8601 format unless otherwise specified
