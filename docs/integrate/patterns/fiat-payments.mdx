Accept credit cards via Stripe, with no crypto wallet required. Fiat payments are the fastest path to mainstream adoption -- your users can start paying with a card they already have.

## When to Use Fiat Payments

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Enterprise Adoption" icon="building">
    Organizations that already pay for SaaS with corporate cards can onboard without touching crypto.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Mainstream Users" icon="users">
    No wallet setup, no token bridging. Users pay with the card in their pocket.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Regulatory Compliance" icon="scale-balanced">
    Fiat-denominated billing simplifies accounting, invoicing, and compliance for businesses.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Instant Onboarding" icon="bolt">
    Users go from discovery to first API call in seconds. No wallet funding step required.

## Fiat Payment Scenarios

Nevermined supports fiat payments in two scenarios:

- **Human-to-Agent**: A user visits the Nevermined App checkout page and purchases a plan with their credit card. This is the simplest flow for onboarding new customers.
- **Agent-to-Agent**: An agent owner enrolls a credit card and delegates payment permissions to an agent. The agent can then make autonomous payments on behalf of the owner, charging the delegated card per request.

## Pay-per-request or a bundle of credits

Nevermined offers two distinct fiat payment flows depending on whether you want upfront plan purchases or per-request charging.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Plan Purchase" icon="cart-shopping">
    One-time or recurring payment via Stripe Checkout. The user buys a plan, a webhook confirms the payment, and credits are minted on-chain. Best for human users who want a familiar checkout experience.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Card Delegation (x402)" icon="key">
    Per-request charging via the x402 protocol. The user delegates their card with spending limits, and the agent charges it off-session for each request. Best for automated workflows and agent-to-agent payments.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Human-to-Agent Purchase Flow

The simplest way to accept fiat. Users complete a standard Stripe Checkout session, and Nevermined handles the rest.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select a plan">
    The user browses available plans in the Nevermined App or your custom UI and selects one priced in fiat.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Redirect to Stripe Checkout">
    Nevermined creates a Stripe Checkout session and redirects the user to complete payment with their card.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Payment completes">
    Stripe processes the charge. For recurring plans, Stripe manages subsequent billing automatically.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Webhook confirms payment">
    Nevermined receives a webhook from Stripe confirming the successful payment.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Credits minted on-chain">
    The corresponding credits are minted to the subscriber's account, and they can immediately start using the agent.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Both one-time and recurring plan purchases are supported. For recurring plans, Stripe handles rebilling and Nevermined mints fresh credits each billing cycle.

## Agent-to-Agent Purchase Flow

Fully autonomous agent-to-agent payments in fiat are enabled through card delegation. This allows an agent to charge a user's card on-demand, without the user needing to pre-purchase credits. Instead of buying credits upfront, the user authorizes Nevermined to charge their card within defined limits.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Card Enrollment">
    The user enrolls a Card as a payment method. The cards is registered through VGS (Very Good Security) to ensure PCI compliance, and a token is created that represents the card without exposing sensitive data.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Authorize delegation">
    The user authorizes a card delegation through the Nevermined App, setting spending limits (max total spend, max transactions, expiration date).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Receive delegation token">
    The user receives a delegation token that encodes their card authorization and spending limits.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Per-request charging via x402">
    When the agent makes a request, it includes the delegation token using the `nvm:card-delegation` x402 scheme. The facilitator charges the delegated card off-session for each request.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Settlement via Stripe">
    Stripe creates a PaymentIntent and charges the card without the user being present. The agent receives access to the requested resource.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Card delegation is what enables fiat-based agent-to-agent payments. An agent owner delegates their card, and the agent can autonomously pay for services from other agents -- all settled in fiat.
</Note>

## Permission Model

Card delegations enforce strict spending limits to protect the cardholder. Each delegation has three controls:

| Limit | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `spendingLimitCents` | Maximum total amount (in cents) that can be charged across all transactions |
| `maxTransactions` | Maximum number of individual charges allowed |
| `expiresAt` | Expiration date after which the delegation becomes invalid |

A delegation moves through a simple lifecycle:

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **Active** | The delegation is valid and can be used for charges |
| **Exhausted** | The spending limit or transaction count has been reached |
| **Expired** | The expiration date has passed |
| **Revoked** | The cardholder manually revoked the delegation |

Once a delegation leaves the **Active** state, a new one must be created to continue charging.

## Security and PCI Compliance

Card data never reaches Nevermined servers. All sensitive card information is tokenized through **VGS (Very Good Security)**, a PCI-compliant proxy, before it reaches the facilitator. Nevermined only stores Stripe tokens, never raw card numbers.

<Note>
**Nevermined is PCI compliant** (PCI SAQ D level). VGS tokenizes card data in transit, and Stripe manages secure storage and charging. Your users' card data is protected by industry-standard security at every step.
</Note>


## Revenue Routing with Stripe Connect

When a user pays with a card, Nevermined routes the revenue to the builder's connected Stripe account using Stripe Connect. Fees are deducted automatically before the payout reaches the builder.

This means you receive funds directly in your Stripe account -- no manual transfers or reconciliation needed.

## Fees and Settlement

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Nevermined fee | 2% of the transaction amount |
| Stripe processing fee | $0.50 + 4% per transaction |
| Settlement | Via Stripe PaymentIntents to builder's connected account |

<Warning>
Fiat payments carry higher fees than stablecoin payments (2% + Stripe fees vs. 1% flat). For high-volume or high-value use cases, consider [stablecoin payments](/docs/integrate/patterns/stablecoin-payments) to reduce costs.
</Warning>
