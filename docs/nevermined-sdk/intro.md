# What is the Nevermined SDK?

The Nevermined SDK is a low level library which does the intermediate between the client and the diffent backend services like [Marketplace API](../architecture/marketplace-api/index.md), [Gateway](../architecture/gateway/index.md), [Smart Contracts](../architecture/contracts/index.md), etc...

# When should I use Nevermined SDK?

You should use Nevermined SDK if you project isn't developed using [React](https://reactjs.org/) otherwise we recommend to use [Nevermined Catalog](../catalog/intro.md). As we mentioned before, the **SDK** is a low level library and **Catalog** can make much easier developing dApps in React.
