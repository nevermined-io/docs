# What is the Nevermined SDK?

The Nevermined SDK is a low level library which functions as an intermediate between the client and the different backend services like [Marketplace API](../architecture/marketplace-api/index.md), [Node](../architecture/node/index.md), [Smart Contracts](../architecture/contracts/index.md), etc...

# When should I use the Nevermined SDK?

You should use Nevermined SDK if your project isn't developed using [React](https://reactjs.org/). If you do use React, we recommend to use [Nevermined Catalog](../catalog/intro.md). As we mentioned before, the **SDK** is a low level library and **Catalog** makes developing dApps in React easier.
