# Nevermined Gateway

In the Nevermined ecosystem, the [Gateway](https://github.com/nevermined-io/gateway-ts/) is
the technical component executed by the Publishers allowing them to provide extended data
services (e.g. storage and compute).

Nevermined Gateway, as part of the Publisher ecosystem, includes the credentials to interact
with the infrastructure (initially cloud, but could be on-premise).

Typically the gateway works in the frontier between off-chain data and services and the rest of the world, and facilitate the delivery of data or services to the consumers that go through the service agreements.
