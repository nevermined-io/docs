# Connecting to Nevermined from the command line

The Nevermined CLI (aka NVM CLI or `ncli`) allows to interact with a Nevermined deployment from the command line interface allowing to do everything is supported from a traditional Nevermined web environment like a Marketplace or similar DApp.

The `ncli` allows to connect to a local Nevermined environment (see in the [Nevermined Tools tutorial](running-locally.md) how to do that) or with a remote one.

This tutorial will show some of the basics about how to use the `ncli` and get quick information about what's going on in a Nevermined environment.

## Getting Started

You can find more details in the [`ncli` documentation page](../cli/getting-started.md), but basically what we need is to install the `ncli` software packaged in `NPM` format. This means you can installed easilly in your environment running one of the following commands:

```
npm install -g @nevermined-io/cli

or

yarn global add @nevermined-io/cli
```

After doing that you should have available in your system the `ncli` tool.

```
$ ncli --version
$ ncli --help
```

### Creating a new account

If you don't have an account locally or you want to use a new one to use the `ncli`, create it is very simple, you just need to use the `ncli`:

```
ncli accounts new

Wallet Mnemonic:
  Phrase: street fever feed resource place adapt venue mobile hill try armed feature
  Path: m/44'/60'/0'/0/0
  Locale: en

If you want to use it in the CLI run:
export MNEMONIC="street fever feed resource place adapt venue mobile hill try armed feature"
```

As the command output says, you just need to export the `MNEMONIC` environment variable and start using the `ncli`.

```bash
export MNEMONIC="street fever feed resource place adapt venue mobile hill try armed feature"
```

:::tip

You can find more configuration options in the [`ncli` advanced configuration](../cli/advanced_configuration.md) page.

### Getting Funds

To interact with a blockchain public network you need to own some native tokens in the network where you are connected. You can find some information about how to get funds in a `testnet` in the [Faucets tutorial](https://docs.nevermined.io/docs/tutorials/faucets).


After requesting some `USDC` and `MATIC` on `Mumbai` you can check you have balance using the command:

```bash
$ ncli accounts balance 
===== Account 0x827C6546CA48Ee9a33EFEe3342292E61C6eA6507 - Index: 0 =====
MATIC Balance: 250000000000000000000000000000000000
Token Balance: 180000000000000000000 USDC
Etherscan Url: https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/0x827C6546CA48Ee9a33EFEe3342292E61C6eA6507
NFT Balance: 0

===== Account 0x7064f267187EbD0eDD3e14141f3AF0E5A91047B1 - Index: 1 =====

[...]

```

The command will return the balance for the 10 first derivation paths of your MNEMONIC. By default check the first account balance (Index 0) like in the example.

## Connecting to a Nevermined network

Once you have your account and that account has some funds, we can start interacting with the public networks.

First we are gonna list the available networks:

```bash
ncli network list
```

And later see the status of any of them:

```bash
ncli --network testnet network status
```

:::info

By default Nevermined `ncli` uses the `testnet` network that is connected to `Polygon Mumbai`. So if you don't pass the `--network` parameter it will use that by default.

## Registering an asset tokenized via NFTs

Nevermiend allows the tokenization of assets via the association of them with a NFT contract based on a `ERC-721` or `ERC-1155` (see more about the [differences between the different NFT token standards](https://www.rfox.finance/blogs/erc-721-vs-erc-1155-tokens-a-comparison-guide-of-ethereum-nft-standards)).

You have some information about how to do this using a `ERC-721` in the [CLI documentation](../cli/using-cli.md#nfts), so for this tutorial we are gonna use NFTs based on `ERC-1155` to have a different example.

Let's define first what is our use case:

:::note Use Case

As a content creator I want to tokenize a fractal I created. I want to make available **10 editions** of it, and sell them for **100 USDC** each of them. Whoever owning one of these editions will be able to have **exclusive access** to the fractal file.

:::

### Register the asset on Nevermined

First let's upload the fractal file to IPFS:

```bash
$ ncli utils upload fractal.1920x1080.jpg 
URL: cid://bafkreiabenhumlyfecdaz546ycvh6lljsf7og7qwu6f6vzhpqq4lcgutn4
Password: /S8%sx;]}sK=I+vwZc3/wYgr1Z<<~BFH
```

And now let's register the asset in Nevermined. As you see in the command options we are capping the NFT to 10 editions:

```bash
$ ncli nfts1155 create --name 'Badass fractal' --author 'John Doe' --price 100 --urls cid://bafkreiabenhumlyfecdaz546ycvh6lljsf7og7qwu6f6vzhpqq4lcgutn4 --contentType image/jpeg --cap 10

Now please mint the token on the NFT Contract!

```

The `DID` returned is the unique identifier of the asset created in a Nevermined network. You can fetch all the metadata associated to the asset just asking for that `DID`:

```bash
$ ncli nfts1155 show did:nv:e4cd0187b8d8d0db4a03e31fbdda2cf088d28789c93b24bf2f58bc9763bac211

:::info Nevermined doesn't store your data

Nevermined never stores your files in any way. In most of the cases these are stored in a marketplace, your own infrastructure or a public netwkork. Nevermined just store internal ids and metadata to allow the transactions between parties to happen.

:::

### Minting

We didn't mint any edition during the NFT creation (that is possible using the `--preMint` parameter), so let's mint the 10 editions:

```bash
$ ncli nfts1155 mint did:nv:e4cd0187b8d8d0db4a03e31fbdda2cf088d28789c93b24bf2f58bc9763bac211 --amount 10

```

If now you run the same `show` command as before you can notice in the balance the asset creator owns the 10 editions just minted:

```bash
$ ncli nfts1155 show did:nv:e4cd0187b8d8d0db4a03e31fbdda2cf088d28789c93b24bf2f58bc9763bac211

```

## Discovering the asset created

So now our tokenized asset is published, let's use a different account to purchase the asset and download the fractal file. In a different terminal let's create a new account as we did before:

```
$ ncli accounts new

Wallet Mnemonic:

  Path: m/44'/60'/0'/0/0
  Locale: en

If you want to use it in the CLI run:
export MNEMONIC="elite cry swim vintage twelve choose lamp hazard blossom reject crew captain"

$ export MNexport MNEMONIC="elite cry swim vintage twelve choose lamp hazard blossom reject crew captain"
```

And we fund the account with the public faucets. Please see the [Faucets tutorial](https://docs.nevermined.io/docs/tutorials/faucets).



So as a consumer I can search for fractal assets:

```bash
$ ncli assets search  "Fractal"

Search using query: Fractal
Total Results: [object Object] - Total Pages: 1
Page: 1

```

And see the details of the NFT:

```
$ ncli nfts1155 show did:nv:e4cd0187b8d8d0db4a03e31fbdda2cf088d28789c93b24bf2f58bc9763bac211

## Purchase the NFT using a different user


So now using the consumer account we created we can purchase the NFT attached to the Fractal asset:

```bash
ncli nfts1155 order did:nv:e4cd0187b8d8d0db4a03e31fbdda2cf088d28789c93b24bf2f58bc9763bac211
```

If everything went okay, now you should be able to download the files attached to the asset and protected by the NFT as access control:

```bash
ncli nfts1155 download did:nv:e4cd0187b8d8d0db4a03e31fbdda2cf088d28789c93b24bf2f58bc9763bac211 --destination /tmp
```
