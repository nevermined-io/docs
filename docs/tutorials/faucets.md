# Getting tokens from faucets in `testnet` environments

If you just created your account with the CLI, remember the command told us our account address: `Wallet address: 0x37434d6673ff106446c9224884D54201e5Ae46A4`

## Native tokens

To interact with a blockchain network you need to have balance in the tokens related with the transaction you need to do. For example if you want write anything on-chain as a result of calling a Smart Contract, you need to pay for that in the specific network native token (`ETH`, `MATIC`, etc). In a testnet, it's possible to get some of them using a public faucet. 

### Getting testnet ETH

https://faucet.quicknode.com/arbitrum/sepolia dispenses a small amount of ETH.

* Select Arbitrum and Sepolia from the dropdowns.
* Connect your MetaMask to complete the wallet address field.
* Optionally you can tweet to double the amount of test ETH you will receive. (note: the faucet might say ARB, but your MetaMask will say ETH ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)

Alternatively, you can use the **[Sepolia Faucet](https://sepoliafaucet.com/)** to get some ETH.

Getting USDC in Sepolia (or any other testnet network) is quick and simple. Just visit the [Circle faucet](https://faucet.circle.com/), select Arbitrum Sepolia (or any other network) and paste your address.

You can get **10 USDC** per day.
