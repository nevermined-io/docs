# Initializing the Library

This guide shows how to initialize the Nevermined Payments Library in your application. The library supports both server-side (Node.js) and browser environments with different initialization methods.

## Get Your NVM API Key

Before initializing the library, you need a Nevermined API key:

1. Visit [nevermined.app](https://nevermined.app)
2. Sign in or create a free account
3. Navigate to your profile settings
4. Generate an API key

**Important**: There are two types of API keys:
- **Builder Key**: For AI builders who register agents and payment plans
- **Subscriber Key**: For users who purchase access and query agents

Most applications will use a builder key for server-side operations.

## Server-Side Initialization

For Node.js applications, use the `getInstance` method:

```typescript
import { Payments, EnvironmentName } from '@nevermined-io/payments'

const payments = Payments.getInstance({
  nvmApiKey: process.env.NVM_API_KEY!,
  environment: 'sandbox' as EnvironmentName,
})
```

### Configuration Options

The `getInstance` method accepts a `PaymentOptions` object:

```typescript
interface PaymentOptions {
  nvmApiKey: string          // Your Nevermined API key (required)
  environment: EnvironmentName  // Target environment (required)
  returnUrl?: string         // OAuth callback URL (optional, for browser)
  appId?: string             // Your application ID (optional)
  version?: string           // Your application version (optional)
}
```

### Complete Server-Side Example

```typescript
import { Payments, EnvironmentName } from '@nevermined-io/payments'

// Initialize with environment variables
const payments = Payments.getInstance({
  nvmApiKey: process.env.NVM_API_KEY!,
  environment: process.env.NVM_ENVIRONMENT as EnvironmentName,
})

// Verify connection
const accountAddress = payments.getAccountAddress()
console.log(`Connected as: ${accountAddress}`)
```

## Browser Initialization

For browser-based applications, use the `getBrowserInstance` method:

```typescript
import { Payments } from '@nevermined-io/payments'

const payments = Payments.getBrowserInstance({
  returnUrl: 'https://myapp.example/callback',
  environment: 'sandbox',
  appId: 'my-app',
  version: '1.0.0',
})
```

### Browser Authentication Flow

The browser instance supports OAuth-style authentication:

```typescript
// Check if user is logged in
if (!payments.isLoggedIn) {
  // Redirect to Nevermined login
  payments.connect()
}

// After login, use the payments instance
const balance = await payments.plans.getPlanBalance(planId)

// Logout when needed
payments.logout()
```

## Environments

The Nevermined protocol supports multiple environments:

### Production Environments

| Environment | Description | Usage |
|-------------|-------------|-------|
| `sandbox` | Production testing environment | Development and testing with real blockchain |
| `live` | Production environment | Live agents and real payments |

### Choosing an Environment

```typescript
// Development and testing
const payments = Payments.getInstance({
  nvmApiKey: process.env.NVM_API_KEY!,
  environment: 'sandbox',
})

// Production deployment
const payments = Payments.getInstance({
  nvmApiKey: process.env.NVM_API_KEY!,
  environment: 'live',
})
```

**Important**: Agents and plans registered in one environment cannot be accessed from another. Always use the same environment throughout your application.

## Environment Configuration Details

Each environment has specific API endpoints:

```typescript
// Example environment structure
interface EnvironmentInfo {
  frontend: string   // Nevermined App URL
  backend: string    // API URL
  proxy: string      // Proxy service URL
  heliconeUrl: string // Observability service URL
}
```

The library automatically configures these endpoints based on your chosen environment.

## Verify Connection

After initialization, verify the connection is working:

```typescript
import { Payments, EnvironmentName } from '@nevermined-io/payments'

const payments = Payments.getInstance({
  nvmApiKey: process.env.NVM_API_KEY!,
  environment: 'sandbox' as EnvironmentName,
})

// Get account address from API key
const accountAddress = payments.getAccountAddress()
console.log(`Initialized for account: ${accountAddress}`)

// For browser instances
if (payments.isLoggedIn) {
  console.log('User authenticated successfully')
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Environment Variables**: Always store API keys in environment variables, never hardcode them
2. **Singleton Pattern**: Create one Payments instance per application
3. **Environment Consistency**: Use the same environment for all operations in a session
4. **Error Handling**: Wrap initialization in try-catch blocks for production apps

```typescript
import { Payments, EnvironmentName } from '@nevermined-io/payments'

let payments: Payments

try {
  payments = Payments.getInstance({
    nvmApiKey: process.env.NVM_API_KEY!,
    environment: process.env.NVM_ENVIRONMENT as EnvironmentName,
  })
  console.log('✓ Nevermined Payments initialized')
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Failed to initialize Payments:', error)
  process.exit(1)
}
```
