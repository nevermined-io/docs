# Installation

The Nevermined Payments Library is a TypeScript SDK that enables AI builders and subscribers to monetize and access AI agents through the Nevermined protocol. The library supports flexible payment plans (credits and time-based), multiple payment methods (crypto and fiat), and seamless integration with AI agent frameworks.

## Overview

The Payments Library provides:
- Registration and discovery of AI agents with payment plans
- Flexible pricing options (fixed per request or dynamic usage-based)
- Credit-based access control with on-chain settlement
- Support for browser and Node.js environments
- Integration with MCP (Model Context Protocol) and A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocols

## Prerequisites

Before installing the Nevermined Payments Library, ensure you have:

- **Node.js**: Version 18.x or higher
- **TypeScript**: Version 5.x or higher (recommended)
- **Nevermined API Key**: Get your free API key from [nevermined.app](https://nevermined.app)
- **Package Manager**: npm (included with Node.js) or yarn

## Installation

Install the library using npm or yarn:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install @nevermined-io/payments

# Using yarn
yarn add @nevermined-io/payments
```

### Peer Dependencies

The library has optional peer dependencies for specific integrations:

```bash
# For MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration
npm install @modelcontextprotocol/sdk

# For Express-based HTTP agents
npm install express @types/express
```

These dependencies are only required if you're using the respective integration features.

## Verify Installation

After installation, verify the library is correctly installed by importing it:

```typescript
import { Payments } from '@nevermined-io/payments'

console.log('Nevermined Payments Library installed successfully!')
```

You can also check the installed version:

```bash
npm list @nevermined-io/payments
```

## Next Steps

After successful installation:

1. Get your Nevermined API key from [nevermined.app](https://nevermined.app)
2. Choose your environment (sandbox for testing, live for production)
3. Initialize the Payments instance in your application

Continue to [Initializing the Library](./initializing-the-library) to get started.
