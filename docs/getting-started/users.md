# Who can use Nevermined

Nevermined is designed by Web3 builders for Web3 builders: those who are working with digital assets and NFT technology, but want to add advanced utility to these assets.

In other words, every Web3 developer. ðŸ˜‚

Maybe youâ€™re building a platform, a dApp, a marketplace or a DAO.
Maybe you work directly for an Asset Creator (a musician, a data team, a real estate company,...), whoâ€™s looking for new ways to create value with their assets.

Building on Nevermined will give you the benefit of being able to integrate production-ready and hardened components into your stack and your existing smart contracts.

Currently, Nevermined is available in two ways, for different development approaches:

- All advanced functionalities are available via our [SDK](../nevermined-sdk/intro)
- For apps made in React, we have functionalities available as a [React Components](../react-components/intro).

Weâ€™re also working on packaging our components in SaaS-solutions.
