# Who can use Nevermined

Nevermined is for teams and organizations that are working with data, AI or Web3/NFT technology. 

Thatâ€™s a huge amount of people. ðŸ˜‚

The desire to share data across silos and geographic boundaries is not new for data scientists. The desire to keep AI as open and accessible as possible and to be able to stand on the shoulders of giants, for the common good, is not new. 

So any team, organization or individual that sees Data and AI as economic assets, with incentives, IP rights,... can benefit from using Nevermined. 

Currently, Nevermined is geared towards developers and is available in two ways, for different development approaches. 

- If you want to use a low-level library, you can use our [SDK](../nevermined-sdk/intro)
- For apps made in React, we have functionalities available as [React Components](../react-components/intro).

Weâ€™re also working on packaging our components in SaaS-solutions.
