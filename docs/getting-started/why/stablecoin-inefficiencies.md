# Stablecoin inefficiencies

Unlike credits, stablecoins - or any fungible token - can’t directly represent a claim on an agent’s underlying services. Stablecoins thus fail to commoditize or bring on-chain a unique claim to the agent’s computational power, or be able to represent its value. Thus stablecoin can’t operate as the direct settlement currency.
