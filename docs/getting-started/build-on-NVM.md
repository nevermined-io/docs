# What can you build on Nevermined

Nevermined is use-case agnostic and can be applied to any project or ecosystem looking to bring Web3 utility to Data and/or AI. 

Nevermined can be useful for any project that can benefit from any of these: 

- DATA AVAILABILITY TOOLS
NVM allows organizations to register, tokenize and transform data so that it can be used in analytics by algorithms and AIs.

- OPEN AI & COMPUTE SERVICES
NVM facilitates the use of our native AI services, as well as “Bring your own model” to be trained on NVM’s ecosystem of data, or to be tokenized. 

- ARTIFACT MANAGEMENT & INCENTIVES
