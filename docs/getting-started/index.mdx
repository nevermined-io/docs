# What is Nevermined?

Nevermined is a digital ecosystems builder solution that provides the capabilities of
creating bespoke networks where different entities can interact around digital assets.
This interaction between parties allow to them data sharing, tokenization and 
monetization of their digital assets in an efficient and secure way between 
untrusted parties.

Nevermined is the product powered by [Nevermined AG](https://nevermined.io).

## Capabilities

* **Assets Tokenization via NFTs** — content creators can tokenize their digital 
  assets and make them available to their community of users allowing selling them,
  exclusive access to NFT holders, secondary market and royalties enforcement
* **Data Sharing** — enabling the sharing and access of digital assets between 
  untrusted parties in the data ecosystem
* **Data In-Situ Computation**  — allowing the execution of models and algorithms 
  without moving the data
* **Marketplace** — the user interfaces gluing all together and facilitating user
   interactions with the rest of the digital ecosystem
* **Data Monetization and Incentives** — facilitating the monetization of existing 
  organization assets and the different mechanisms to incentivize the users of a 
  digital ecosystem
* **Data Governance** — making possible to build the agreements that allow to 
  handle an ecosystem with multiple and independent participants


## Digital Ecosystem Principles

During the design and construction of Nevermined, we identified **6 key factors**
for the adoption and usage of a digital ecosystem and its continued growth:

* **Culture** - Culture & Organization help to establish how each ecosystem actor
  interact with others.  We promote it giving a user centric approach
* **User Experience (UX)** - The ecosystems should provide an excellent User
  eXperience, facilitating the participation of all the partners and users
* **Trust** - Data ecosystems must promote trustful environments where untrusted
  parties can collaborate
* **Integrity** - Data integrity and provenance as first class citizens where the
  ecosystem users can validate that data doesn't change and from where is coming
* **Compliance** - Data first approach compliance with all the data regulatory
  requirements
* **Incentives** - We promote the usage and retention of digital ecosystems via
  gamification and providing additional value


## Use Cases

Nevermined is a platform agnostic solution enabling data use cases where
different parties don't trust each other.
It allows to provide digital ecosystems where **DATA OWNERS** need to share and
monetize their data with third-party people, but they want to keep the privacy
and the control of their data.

Typical use cases are:

* **Digital Marketplaces** - Allowing content creators to directly interact with their
  users. Nevermined allows data sharing, NFTs minting and selling, secondary marketts,
  royalties enforcement, access to exclusive content, etc
* **Banking** - Data Sharing with the regulator or internal across different
  jurisdictions
* **Telco** - Anonymized Data Sharing with the regulator and partners. AI without 
  moving the data  
* **Health & Pharma** - AI over medical results of different hospitals without
  revealing PI
* **Supply Chain** - Provenance, integrity and tracking of goods
* **Automotive** - Data Sharing for AI to promote the autonomous cars
* **Others** - Real estate, digital assets tokenization, ..
