# What is Nevermined?

Nevermined provides developer tools and templates to unlock the next level utility of digital assets. 

We believe Web3 will unlock its potential when digital assets can be shared, built upon, combined and remixed. That requires advanced utility for digital assets. Nevermined provides the open infrastructure to make that possible. We call these capabilities Asset Interactivity and will usher in the next wave of Web3 growth. Nevermined allows you to turn anything and everything into a Web3-ready asset.

Why? Because Web3 is more than JPEGs on a blockchain. 

Nevermined consists of a set of Web3 tech components that enable you to level up your dApps with composable advanced features, with less time and complexity.

Nevermined components can be integrated into any Web3 stack and are currently available via SDK or via Catalog.
