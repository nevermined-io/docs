Nevermined helps you monetize **AI-enabled services** — whether that’s an agent, an MCP tool/server, or access to a protected resource (like a dataset or file). At the heart of the platform are two concepts:

- **Services & Resources**: the thing you’re charging for (an API, a tool, or gated access)
- **Payment Plans**: how customers pay and what they’re entitled to consume

## What is a Service or Resource?

In the Nevermined ecosystem, a *service* is anything you expose for paid access. That might be:

- **AI Agents**: autonomous or human-in-the-loop agents you call via HTTP.
- **MCP Tools / Servers**: monetizable tool endpoints accessed via the MCP.
- **Protected Assets**: gated resources like files, datasets, prompts, or static downloads.

Regardless of the form factor, a monetizable service/resource typically has:

- A **public interface** (HTTP endpoint, MCP tool, or download URL)
- A **pricing + access policy** (a payment plan)
- A **verification step** (validate entitlement before delivering)
- **Usage tracking** (meter and redeem credits per request or per access)

## Standards and protocols (x402)

Nevermined supports modern payment standards used in AI and API commerce. In particular, **x402** standardizes how clients and servers negotiate payment-required requests, enabling smoother, interoperable monetization flows.

If you're integrating with x402-compatible clients/servers, see the [x402 integration](/docs/development-guide/nevermined-x402).

## What is a Payment Plan?

A Payment Plan is a set of rules and conditions that define how subscribers pay to access your service/resource. Plans are defined by two main components: their **price** and the **consumption** model.

### Key Attributes of a Payment Plan

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Payment Method" icon="credit-card">
    Choose whether customers pay in **Fiat** (via Stripe) or **Crypto** (including stablecoins).
  </Card>
  <Card title="Pricing & Receivers" icon="sack-dollar">
    Define price, payout currency, and how revenue is distributed across one or more receivers.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Plan Types" icon="calendar-days">
    - **Time-based**: limited by duration (e.g., 30 days, 1 year)
    - **Credits-based**: limited by usage (e.g., 100 requests)
    - **Trial**: free limited access for testing
  </Card>
  <Card title="Consumption & Settlement" icon="coins">
    Choose how usage is paid for:

    - **Credits**: prepaid balance redeemed per request/access
    - **Pay-as-you-go (PAYG)**: settle in USDC as it happens
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Credits-Based Plans">
    Perfect for usage-based pricing models:

    - **Fixed Credits**: set amount of credits (e.g., 100 credits)
    - **Credits per Request**: set how many credits each request consumes
    - **Flexible Redemption**: redeem different amounts based on usage
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Pay-as-you-go (PAYG)">
    Ideal when you want to avoid pre-purchased credits and settle usage as it occurs:

    - **Per-request settlement**: settle in USDC as each request happens
    - **No credit balance**: customers pay on demand rather than topping up credits
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Time-Based Plans">
    Ideal for subscription models:

    - **Duration**: set expiration time (days, months, years)
    - **Unlimited Usage**: within the time period
    - **Auto-expiry**: plan expires after duration
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Hybrid Plans">
    Combine time and credits:

    - **Credits with Expiry**: e.g., 1000 credits valid for 30 days
    - **Rate Limiting**: control usage within time periods
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Example Payment Plans

- **Customer Support MCP Tool**: $49/month for unlimited usage, or $10 for 1,000 calls.
- **Dataset Access**: $99 for 30-day access to a protected resource.
- **Agent API**: $10 for 100 credits, with each request consuming 1 credit.

## How It All Works Together

<Steps>
  <Step title="Register the service/resource">
    Define your service interface (API, MCP tool, or protected asset) and metadata.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create plans">
    Create one or more payment plans: pricing, credits, duration, and consumption rules.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customers purchase access">
    Users buy plans using fiat or crypto and receive entitlements.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Validate before delivery">
    Validate entitlement (tokens / headers / proxy validation) before serving requests or granting access.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Meter usage">
    Automatically redeem credits per request/access and track consumption.
  </Step>
</Steps>

By combining services/resources with flexible payment plans, Nevermined supports monetization across agents, MCP tools, and protected assets.
