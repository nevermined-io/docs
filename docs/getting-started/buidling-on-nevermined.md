# Why we are building nevermined

We believe that the killer feature of Web3 is digital assets with embedded conditions and verifiable provenance. This is the atomic unit of value. 

Building on Nevermined caters to the formation of Digital Ecosystems around Creators and their asset(s), with different participants helping to create and share value.

We believe that this approach is necessary to establish the true utility of all digital assets, and from this utility will emerge agency for all assets and their creators. Without this evolution, we also believe there’s a danger we get stuck in Web2 mechanics. 

In Web2, the unit of value is data. 
Data in itself isn’t valuable…It’s what Data Consumers do with it: combine it, analyze it, enrich it, slice and dice it, etc, that gives an asset relevance and, therefore, value

In Web3, the unit of value is the digital asset.
Some digital assets may have inherent value, but it’s really what Asset Consumers will do with it that will generate the real value.

The opportunity for Nevermined lies in unlocking and enabling the real value of digital assets!
