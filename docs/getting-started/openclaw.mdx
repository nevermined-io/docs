The [Nevermined OpenClaw plugin](https://github.com/nevermined-io/openclaw-plugin) brings AI agent payments into any chat channel. Install it on an [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) gateway and your users can subscribe to plans, check balances, and query paid agents — all from Telegram, Discord, WhatsApp, or any other connected channel.

## What is OpenClaw?

OpenClaw is an open-source AI gateway that connects large language models to messaging platforms. It turns chat channels into AI-powered assistants by routing messages through configurable plugins.

The Nevermined plugin extends OpenClaw with **7 payment tools** and **2 slash commands**, giving every connected channel full access to the Nevermined payment infrastructure.

## Use Cases

### Paid AI Assistants in Group Chats

Deploy a specialized AI agent (legal advisor, data analyst, coding tutor) and let users pay per query directly from a Telegram or Discord group. The plugin handles credit checks and settlement transparently.

### Agent-to-Agent Commerce via Chat

Connect multiple OpenClaw gateways so one agent can call another's paid endpoint. The subscriber gateway acquires an x402 token and sends it automatically — enabling autonomous agent-to-agent transactions.

### Rapid Prototyping for AI Monetization

Test your pricing model without writing a frontend. Register an agent and plan from chat, enable the paid endpoint, and start collecting payments in minutes.

## How It Works

```

(Telegram, Discord)   (with Nevermined plugin)   Protocol
      │                        │                     │
      │  "Query the agent"     │                     │
      │───────────────────────>│                     │
      │                        │  getAccessToken()   │
      │                        │────────────────────>│
      │                        │<────────────────────│
      │                        │                     │
      │                        │  POST /agent        │
      │                        │  + payment-signature│
      │                        │────────────────────>│ verify + settle
      │                        │<────────────────────│
      │  Agent response        │                     │
      │<───────────────────────│                     │
```

1. A user sends a message in any connected chat channel
2. The plugin acquires an x402 access token from Nevermined
3. The request is forwarded to the agent with a `payment-signature` header
4. Nevermined verifies the subscriber's balance, processes the request, and settles credits
5. The response is returned to the chat channel
