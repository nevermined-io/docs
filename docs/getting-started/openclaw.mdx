The [Nevermined OpenClaw plugin](https://github.com/nevermined-io/openclaw-plugin) brings AI agent payments into any chat channel. Install it on an [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) gateway and your users can subscribe to plans, check balances, and query paid agents — all from Telegram, Discord, WhatsApp, or any other connected channel.

## What is OpenClaw?

OpenClaw is an open-source AI gateway that connects large language models to messaging platforms. It turns chat channels into AI-powered assistants by routing messages through configurable plugins.

The Nevermined plugin extends OpenClaw with **7 payment tools** and **2 slash commands**, giving every connected channel full access to the Nevermined payment infrastructure.

## What You Can Do

- **Paid chatbot over private data** — Build a chatbot that answers questions against your proprietary knowledge base and put a paywall in front of it. Users subscribe to a plan and pay per query — you monetize your data without exposing it.
- **Autonomous paid agent** — Deploy a standalone AI agent that other agents can discover and query programmatically. The x402 protocol handles payment negotiation automatically, so your agent earns revenue with zero manual intervention.
- **Multi-agent orchestrator** — Build an orchestrator service that delegates tasks to specialized paid agents. The orchestrator acquires access tokens, pays each agent per request, and combines their outputs — enabling complex workflows across independent providers.
- **Knowledge marketplace** — Create a shared chat channel where multiple independent experts (human or AI) register as paid agents. Users browse available agents, subscribe to the ones they need, and get answers in the same conversation — turning any group chat into a pay-per-use knowledge marketplace.
