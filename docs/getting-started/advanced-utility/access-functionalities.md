# Access Functionalities

NVM Access Functionalities help you build and deploy tokengating with tokens/NFTs that grant holders unique and customisable access to your platforms, dApps or content/assets. The result: you are now free to innovate your business and revenue models with tokengating, subscriptions and credits. <br />
<br />

**Access Utility 1 - Tokengating**<br />
_What is it?_ <br />
A feature that allows your users to ‘Log in with an NFT’.<br />

_Why use this?_ <br />
This provides tokenized access to a website, a metaverse, a Discord server, a Telegram channel,...

<br />

**Access Utility 2 - Subscription NFT** <br />
_What is it?_ <br />
An extension of the ERC-721 standard that allows you to add subscription conditions to a token (content-type, expiry,...). <br />

_Why use this?_ <br />
This turns a subscription to online content or services into a Web3-ready digital asset that can be used across multiple environments. Now, you can do things like apply access tiering to NFTs, subdomains, reports,... <br />

<br />

**Access Utility 3 - Credit Token** <br />
_What is it?_ <br />
An extension of the ERC-721 standard that allows you to append credit-related conditions to a token (amount of credits, expiration date,...).

_Why is it important?_ <br />
This adds Web3 utility to any system where you can earn/spend credits. <br />

**Access Utility 4 - File Access tokens** <br />
_What is it?_ <br />
A feature that uses non-fungible token standards to restrict and control access to specific files, both in a cloud and a decentralized environment.

_Why use this?_ <br />
This allows for decentralized access control to off-chain files. If necessary, it can be combined with Decentralized Storage Encryption

<br />

**Access Utility 5 - Decentralized Storage Encryption** <br />
_What is it?_ <br />
A feature that uses zero-knowledge proof tech to encrypt files and data, which are stored in a decentralized solution. <br />

_Why use this?_ <br />
This allows you to use decentralized storage for files that can only be accessed by people with permission (i.e. the encryption key). <br />
