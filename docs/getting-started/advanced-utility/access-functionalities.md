# Decentralized Access Control

NVM Access Functionalities help you use NFT tech to grant holders unique and customisable access to your data environments or web services. The result: you are now free to innovate your business and revenue models with tokengating, NFT subscriptions and credits.
<br />
<br />

**Access Utility 1 - Tokengating Data**<br />
_What is it?_ <br />
A feature that creates tokenized access to walled data.<br />

_Why use this?_ <br />
This increases the value and relevance of walled data. With this feature you can control who has access to data and under which conditions.
<br />
<br />

**Access Utility 2 - Subscription NFT** <br />
_What is it?_ <br />
An extension of the ERC-721 standard that allows you to add subscription conditions to a token (content-type, expiry,...). <br />

_Why use this?_ <br />
To create subscription-based access to any digital asset: data, a web service, an AI application, an image, etc. Turning a subscription into a Web3-ready digital asset allows you to do things like apply access tiering to NFTs, subdomains, reports and even trading the subscription.<br />

<br />

**Access Utility 3 - Access Credits** <br />
_What is it?_ <br />
An extension of the ERC-721 standard that allows you to append credit-related conditions to a token (amount of credits, expiration date,...).

_Why is it important?_ <br />
This adds Web3 utility to any system where you can earn/spend credits. <br />

**Access Utility 4 - File Access NFT** <br />
_What is it?_ <br />
A feature that uses non-fungible token standards to restrict and control access to specific files, both in a cloud and a decentralized environment.

_Why use this?_ <br />
This allows for decentralized access control to off-chain files. If necessary, it can be combined with Decentralized Storage Encryption.

<br />

**Access Utility 5 - Decentralized Storage Encryption** <br />
_What is it?_ <br />
A feature that uses zero-knowledge proof tech to encrypt files and data that are stored in a decentralized solution. <br />

_Why use this?_ <br />
This allows you to use decentralized storage for files that can only be accessed by people with permission (i.e. the encryption key). <br />
