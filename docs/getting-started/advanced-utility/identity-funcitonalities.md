# Indentity Functionalities

Personal identity and data privacy is at the core of the Web3 vision.<br />
NVM Identity Functionalities help you turn identity-related data into Web3 assets, thus unlocking a whole new set of utilities.<br />
<br />

**Identity Utility 1 - POAP**<br />
_What is it?_<br />
A feature that builds on the POAP standard, where a token can be claimed, under certain conditions.<br />

_Why use this?_<br />
This proves the attendance of a certain event and by creating POAPs in Nevermined, they can be combined with other functionalities from the Nevermined stack.<br />

**Identity Utility 2 - Non-Transferrable Tokens**<br />
_What is it?_<br />
A feature that makes Non-Fungible Tokens also non-transferrable. This feature can be used for Soulbound Token implementations or other non-transferable badges.<br />

_Why use this?_<br />
These tokens prove the provenance of certain individual traits, achievements,... and cannot be transferred to other wallets. Combining this with other Nevermined features opens the door for Identity-related use cases.<br />
