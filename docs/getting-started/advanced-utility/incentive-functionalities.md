# Data & AI Incentives

Data and AI economics are based on ideas of scarcity, so assets are walled off and largely undiscoverable. Instead, incentives should drive Data and AI abundance, where assets are available for use and for remixing, in order to advance AI development.<br />

NVM Incentives help you to develop more advanced engagement and collaborative models with your community. The result: data and AI publishers and owners are rewarded for making their assets available, thus unlocking new value streams. 
<br />
<br />

**Incentive Utility 1 - Rewards**<br />

_What is it?_ <br />
A feature that allows you to use tokens, including your native token, to reward getting access to data.<br />

_Why use this?_ <br />
This allows asset producers and content creators to recognize and reward the contributions made by other participants and to stimulate collaborative growth and creation.<br />

**Incentive Utility 2 - Royalties**<br />

_What is it?_<br />
The user registering an asset can specify the royalties that are rewarding the original creator in the secondary market. The royalties can not be changed after they are initialized. This protects the buyers of an asset to have to pay for a different commission to the one agreed during the purchase.<br />

_Why use this?_<br />
We have seen many examples in the NFT art space, where the payout of royalties depends on the goodwill of a marketplace. With this functionality, the royalty conditions are ‘embedded’ in the asset and will be executed upon.<br />

**Incentive Utility 3 - Dynamic Pricing Framework**<br />
_What is it?_<br />
A feature that allows you to define on-chain and off-chain conditions that influence the price of your asset.<br />

_Why use this?_<br />
This allows asset producers to go beyond the one-dimensional pricing strategies. The template comes with a curve model, but the framework allows devs to integrate their own dynamic pricing conditions, e.g. supply/demand, external oracle data,...<br />

**Incentive Utility 4 - Marketplace Framework**<br />
_What is it?_<br />
A framework to create your own Data/AI/asset Marketplace. <br />

_Why use this?_<br />
Rather than build a marketplace from scratch, this allows you to manage all the typical metadata required to build a marketplace.<br />

Dig into [Specs](../../architecture/specs/Spec-MKT/#secondary-market) of the Marketplace API.<br />
<br />

**Incentive Utility 5 - NFT Collateralization**<br />
_What is it?_<br />
An integration with the Aave protocol that allows NFT owners (which could represent data, AI,...) to deposit their tokens, in return for a loan.<br />

_Why use this?_<br />
This allows asset owners to monetize their assets in different ways, while maintaining ownership.<br />
