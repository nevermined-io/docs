# Compute Functionalities

Currently, data is being underused, as the restrictions and regulations around data sharing are stifling innovation.<br />

NVM Compute Functionalities help you turn datasets into Web3-ready assets through its remote, or federated, computing capabilities. The result: you can develop new business models and ecosystems around data to create innovative new products and value streams.<br />
<br />

**Compute Utility 1 - Federated Computation**<br />

_What is it?_<br />
The ability to deploy algorithms and compute on disparate, or “federated” datasets. We support multiple Federated Learning frameworks, including Google’s FL framework.<br />

_Why use this?_<br />
Federated Learning enables algorithmic training and model deployment to decentralized assets without the need to consolidate those assets into centralized repositories. The result is that users can utilize machine learning remotely without the need to move data.<br />

Read about [how Federated Computation can be used](https://medium.com/nevermined-io/nevermined-credit-card-fraud-detection-91aef362d98) or dive into the [Specs of our Remote Compute Service ](../../architecture/specs/Spec-COMPUTE/#execution-of-remote-compute-services-using-service-agreements).<br />
<br />

**Compute Utility 2 - Distributed Computation using analytics frameworks**<br />

_What is it?_<br />
A way to execute Distributed Computation or Massive Parallel Processing (MPP) using analytics frameworks (i.e Spark, Flink).<br />

_Why use this?_<br />
These common frameworks are extremely powerful, enabling the processing of exabytes of data on cheap, commodity hardware. In addition, certain frameworks support the training and deployment of AI.<br />

**Compute Utility 3 - ML & AI Model Royalties**<br />

_What is it?_<br />
A way to tokenize algorithmic models and add Royalty utility to it.<br />

_Why use this?_<br />
This allows data scientists to create new revenue models around their assets.<br />
