## AI Agents Need a New Kind of Payments Infrastructure

The AI economy is growing rapidly, but monetization remains fragmented and inefficient. Most AI builders spend weeks hacking payment solutions instead of building agents, burning time on access control and subscription setup, while leaving money on the table with guesswork pricing.

### The Old Way vs. The Nevermined Way

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="The Old Way" icon="x">
    • Hacking Stripe instead of building agents<br/>
    • Burning weeks on access control + subscription setup<br/>
    • Guessing your pricing, then leaving money on the table<br/>
    • Paying infra bills your agents can't pass on
  </Card>
  <Card title="The Nevermined Way" icon="check">
    • Go live in minutes with just a few clicks<br/>
    • Native usage, outcome, and value-based pricing models<br/>
    • Automatically meter every request and capture the revenue<br/>
    • Supports agent-to-agent and human-to-agent payments natively
