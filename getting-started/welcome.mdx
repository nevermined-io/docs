## AI Agents Need a New Kind of Payments Infrastructure

The AI economy is growing rapidly, but monetizing AI agents remains difficult, relying on fragmented and inefficient solutions. Most AI builders spend weeks hacking payment solutions instead of building agents, burning time on access control and subscriptions while forced to price set through guesswork.

### The Old Way vs. The Nevermined Way

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="The Old Way" icon="x">
    • Hacking Stripe instead of building agents

    • Burning weeks on access control \+ subscription setup

    • Every request = Different cost

    • Pricing = Guesswork

    • Metering = Manual or Missing

    • Trust = Vendor self-reporting usage
  </Card>
  <Card title="The Nevermined Way" icon="check">
    • Go live in minutes with a few clicks

    • 3x price modes: usage, outcome, and value-based

    • Cost observability baked in

    • Target margins in real-time

    • Automatically meter every request

    • Native Agent-to-Agent payments
