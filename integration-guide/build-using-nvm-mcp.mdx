The Nevermined Documentation MCP Server provides seamless access to Nevermined's comprehensive documentation directly within your AI development environment. By integrating this MCP server, you can build AI agents and applications with real-time access to Nevermined's payment infrastructure, API references, and integration guides.

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables AI applications to securely connect to external data sources and tools. Think of MCP as a "USB-C for AI" - it provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different services, documentation, and APIs.

**Key Benefits:**

- 🔌 **Standardized Connections**: Connect any MCP-compatible AI client to our documentation
- 🔄 **Real-time Access**: Always up-to-date information from our docs
- 🛡️ **Secure Integration**: Built-in security and authentication
- 🌍 **Remote Access**: No local installation required

## Prompt Examples for Building AI Agents

Once you have the Nevermined MCP server connected, you can use these example prompts to build AI agents and client applications:

### 1. Create a Basic AI Agent

```text
I want to create an AI agent that validates user requests using Nevermined payments. 
Please show me how to:
1. Register an AI agent with Nevermined
2. Set up payment plans with credit-based pricing
3. Implement request validation in TypeScript
4. Handle authorization errors properly

Include complete code examples and explain each step.
```

### 2. Build a Client Application

```text
Help me build a TypeScript client application that can:
1. Purchase access to a Nevermined AI agent
2. Send authenticated requests to the agent
3. Handle payment errors and reauthorization
4. Monitor remaining credits and subscription status

Show me the complete implementation with error handling.
```

### 3. Multi-Agent Workflow

```text
I want to create a multi-agent system where:
1. Agent A processes text analysis requests
2. Agent B generates summaries based on Agent A's output
3. Both agents use different payment plans
4. Users pay once but can access both agents

How do I implement this workflow using Nevermined? Show me the agent registration, 
payment configuration, and orchestration code.
```

### 4. Payment Plan Configuration

```text
Help me design payment plans for my AI service:
1. A free trial plan (100 requests, 7 days)
2. A basic plan (1000 requests per month, $10 USDC)
3. A premium plan (unlimited requests, $50 USDC per month)

Show me how to implement these plans and handle upgrades/downgrades.
```

### 5. Agent-to-Agent Payments

```text
I'm building an AI agent marketplace where agents can purchase services from other agents. 
Show me how to:
1. Set up autonomous agent-to-agent payments
2. Implement automatic credit management
3. Handle payment authorization between agents
4. Track revenue and usage across multiple agents

Provide complete Python and TypeScript examples.
```

### 6. Integration with Existing Services

```text
I have an existing AI service running on FastAPI. Help me integrate it with Nevermined to:
1. Add payment validation to my existing endpoints
2. Implement subscription management
3. Add usage tracking and analytics
4. Support both crypto and fiat payments

Show me how to modify my existing code with minimal changes.

## Best Practices

When using the Nevermined MCP server, follow these best practices:

### Security Considerations

- **Verify Connections**: Always ensure you're connecting to the official Nevermined MCP server
- **Review Permissions**: Only grant necessary tool permissions in your MCP client
- **Secure API Keys**: Store Nevermined API keys securely and never expose them in client-side code

### Development Workflow

1. **Start with Documentation**: Use the MCP server to understand Nevermined concepts
2. **Test in Sandbox**: Always test your implementations in Nevermined's sandbox environment
3. **Iterate with Examples**: Use the provided code examples as starting points
4. **Monitor Usage**: Implement proper logging and monitoring for production deployments

### Performance Optimization

- **Cache Documentation**: Cache frequently accessed documentation locally when possible
- **Batch Requests**: Group related operations to minimize API calls
- **Implement Retries**: Add retry logic for transient failures
- **Monitor Limits**: Respect rate limits and implement backoff strategies

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Connection Failed

- Verify you're using the correct URL: `https://docs.nevermined.app/mcp`
- Check your internet connection
- Ensure your MCP client supports remote servers

#### Authentication Errors

- Verify your Nevermined API key is correctly configured
- Check that you're using the right environment (sandbox vs production)
- Ensure your API key has the necessary permissions

#### Documentation Not Loading

- Try refreshing the connection in your MCP client
- Check if the MCP server is accessible at: [https://docs.nevermined.app/mcp](https://docs.nevermined.app/mcp)
- Restart your MCP client if issues persist
