Once you have a Payments instance, you can start registering Payment Plans and AI Agents.

## Creating a Payment Plan

Payment Plans give AI Builders the ability to control how and when users can use an AI agent or service. They are entirely controlled and managed by the AI Builder that creates them with no interference from Nevermined.

Nevermined Payment Plans enable the setup of time-based or request-based gating of a Builder's AI.

* **Request-Based or Credits-Based**: Provides user access with request-gating. Builders can manage the number of requests a user can make to access their AI service. This is done by setting the number of credits required to make a request to the AI service/app when adding that service to a Payment Plan. Each time a request is made, Nevermined will redeem the specified number of credits. If the user does not have enough credits, they will be prompted to purchase more and denied access until they do.
* **Time-Based**: Provides user access with time-gating. Builders can set the time period that a user is allowed access to the AI (e.g., 1 year, 1 month, 1 week, 1 day, 1 hour, etc.). When a user makes a request, the corresponding access credit is redeemed, granting access for the designated period. Once the time period has elapsed, the user will no longer have access and will need to redeem another credit for continued access.

      tags: ['test']
    }

    // The price is 20 USDC (20_000_000) in the sandbox network
    const priceConfig = getERC20PriceConfig(20_000_000n, USDC_ERC20_TESTING, builderAddress)
    // The subscriber receives 100 credits upon purchasing the plan

## Creating a Time-Based Payment Plan

## Registering a Trial Plan

A Trial Plan is a special type of Payment Plan that allows users to try out an AI Agent for a limited time (typically for free). A Trial Plan can only be obtained once by each user.

  <Tab title="TypeScript">
    ```typescript  
    const trialPlanMetadata: PlanMetadata = {
      name: 'Try it for one day before you buy it',
    }
    // The price is free
    const freeConfig = getFreePriceConfig()
    // The plan is valid for 1 day
    const oneDayPlanConfig = getExpirableDurationConfig(ONE_DAY_DURATION)
    // Register the trial plan
    const { planId } = await payments.plans.registerTimeTrialPlan(
      trialPlanMetadata, 
      freeConfig, 
      oneDayPlanConfig
    )
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Python">
    ```python
    # Plan metadata for the trial plan
    trial_plan_metadata = PlanMetadata(
        name="Try it for one day before you buy it"
    )

    # The price is free
    free_config = get_free_price_config()
    # The plan is valid for 1 day
    one_day_plan_config = get_expirable_duration_config(ONE_DAY_DURATION)
    # Register the trial plan
    response = payments_builder.plans.register_time_trial_plan(
        trial_plan_metadata,
        free_config,
        one_day_plan_config
    )
    plan_id = response.get("planId")

## Key Concepts

### Endpoint Protection

When registering an AI Agent, you specify:
- **Protected Endpoints**: Require payment/subscription to access
- **Open Endpoints**: Free to access (e.g., documentation, health checks)
- **URL Patterns**: Support wildcards for dynamic routing

### Payment Plan Types

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Credits-Based" icon="coins">
    Users pay for a specific number of credits. Each request consumes credits based on your configuration.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Time-Based" icon="clock">
    Users get unlimited access for a specific time period (hours, days, months).
  </Card>
  <Card title="Trial Plans" icon="gift">
    Free access for limited time or credits to let users test your service.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Plan Naming">
    Use descriptive names that clearly indicate what the plan offers (e.g., "Basic API Access - 1000 requests").
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Pricing Strategy">
    Start with competitive pricing and adjust based on usage patterns and user feedback.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Endpoint Design">
    Group related functionality under the same payment plan to provide better value to subscribers.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Trial Plans">
    Always offer trial plans to reduce barriers to entry and increase conversion rates.
