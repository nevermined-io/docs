## Set up your development environment

This guide walks you through initializing the Nevermined Payments API, registering your first AI agent, attaching a payment plan, and enabling billing, access control, and credit redemption.

### Core setup

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion icon="github" title="Install the Payments API">
    To start using Nevermined's programmable payments, install the Payments module:

    ```bash
    npm install @nevermined-io/payments
    ```

    Then, initialize the client:

    ```ts
    import { Payments } from '@nevermined-io/payments'

    const payments = Payments.getInstance({
      nvmApiKey: process.env.NVM_API_KEY,
      environment: 'production' // or 'testing', 'local', or 'custom'
    })
    ```

    You’ll need a valid Nevermined API Key, which can be created via the [Nevermined App](https://app.nevermined.io).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Start a local agent">
    Your AI agent should be an HTTP-accessible service with a POST endpoint.

    Example setup:
    - Build a FastAPI or Express server
    - Accept a `prompt` and return a response
    - Optionally validate request signatures and usage

    See agent templates in the [examples directory](https://github.com/nevermined-io).
  </Accordion>

## Register an Agent and Payment Plan

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion icon="brain" title="1. Define your Agent Metadata">
    ```ts
    const agentMetadata = {
      name: 'Legal Assistant',
      tags: ['legal', 'ai'],
      dateCreated: new Date()
    }

    const agentApi = {
      endpoints: [{ POST: 'https://your-server.com/query' }]
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="credit-card" title="2. Define the Payment Plan">
    Use `PriceConfig` and `CreditsConfig` to define how much a plan costs and what it grants.

    ```ts
    const price = getERC20PriceConfig(10_000_000n, USDC_ADDRESS, builderAddress)
    const credits = getExpirablePlanCreditsConfig(86400n * 30n) // 1-month plan
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="rocket" title="3. Register Agent and Plan">
    You can register both in one step:

    ```ts
    const { agentId, planId } = await payments.registerAgentAndPlan(
      agentMetadata,
      agentApi,
      price,
      credits
    )
    ```
  </Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## Query the Agent

After a subscriber purchases a plan, they can query the agent using authorized credentials.

```ts
const options = await payments.query.getAgentHTTPOptions(planId, agentId)
const result = await payments.query(agentId, options)
```

Nevermined handles:
	- Validating subscriber access
	- Redeeming credits per request
	- Enforcing usage rules
