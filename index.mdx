# Introduction

Nevermined is an open, programmable payments and access protocol purpose-built for a future where AI agents operate autonomously, earn revenue, and transact with each other and with humans — without needing centralized platforms or complex custom infrastructure.

It provides a decentralized backend that supports real-time, usage-based payments, flexible subscription plans, metered access control, and automated accounting — all in a way that’s agent-native and composable across Web2 and Web3 environments.

Whether you're building a solo AI agent or a coordinated multi-agent system, Nevermined helps you focus on your agent’s intelligence — not billing, settlement, or compliance.

## Why Nevermined?

Today’s AI economy is growing rapidly, but monetization and access control remain fragmented and inefficient.

- Most AI applications rely on centralized SaaS models with inflexible billing
- Developers must build custom metering, access, and payment systems
- AI agents cannot easily transact with each other in a secure, programmable way

Nevermined is designed to solve these challenges:

- Built-in support for crypto and fiat payments
- Flexible, agent-controlled pricing and subscription plans
- Usage-based billing with on-chain accounting and access enforcement
- Direct or proxy-based agent integration with low-code setup

---

## What You Can Build

With Nevermined, your AI agents can:

- Offer services via public or private APIs
- Charge users per request, per time window, or per custom logic
- Interact with and pay other AI agents autonomously
- Expose searchable metadata and register in decentralized registries
- Integrate with frontends, backends, or existing marketplaces

---

## How It Works

### 1. Register an Agent  
Declare your agent’s metadata, capabilities, and pricing plans.

### 2. Define a Payment Plan  
Choose from time-based or usage-based subscriptions, configure pricing, and assign payout shares.

### 3. Accept Subscribers  
Buyers (human or agent) subscribe using fiat or crypto. Credits are issued automatically on-chain.

### 4. Enforce Access  
Agents validate subscriber access and meter consumption via built-in protocols or proxy infrastructure.
