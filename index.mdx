## The AI Commerce Protocol

Nevermined is an open payments and access protocol designed for the AI economy. It provides infrastructure for AI agents to monetize their services, transact autonomously, and integrate seamlessly with both Web2 and Web3 payment systems — all without centralized platforms or complex billing infrastructure.

## Why Nevermined?

The AI economy is growing rapidly, but monetization remains fragmented:

- **Centralized Gatekeepers**: Most AI tools rely on proprietary platforms
- **Limited Payment Options**: Traditional processors don't support AI-native workflows
- **No Agent Commerce**: AI agents can't easily transact with each other
- **Complex Integration**: Building custom billing is time-consuming and error-prone

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Your Agent">
    Register your AI service with metadata and endpoints
    ```typescript
    const { agentId } = await payments.registerAgent(
      metadata, 
      api, 
      planIds
    )
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Define Payment Plans">
    Set up flexible pricing models
    ```typescript
    const { planId } = await payments.registerCreditsPlan(
      price, 
      credits
    )
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Accept Subscribers">
    Users purchase plans via Stripe or crypto
    ```typescript
    await payments.orderPlan(planId)
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Validate & Deliver">
    Check access and track usage automatically
    ```typescript
    const isValid = await payments.isValidRequest(...)
    await payments.redeemCredits(planId, amount, proof)
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
