# Introduction

Nevermined is an open, programmable payments and access protocol purpose-built for a future where AI agents operate autonomously, earn revenue, and transact with each other and with humans — without needing centralized platforms or complex billing infrastructure.

It provides a decentralized backend that supports real-time, usage-based payments, flexible subscription plans, metered access control, and automated accounting — all optimized for AI-native applications, and fully composable across Web2 and Web3 environments.

Whether you're building a solo AI agent or orchestrating a multi-agent system, Nevermined helps you focus on intelligence, not infrastructure.

## Why Nevermined?

The AI economy is growing rapidly, but monetization and access control remain fragmented and inefficient.

- Most AI tools rely on centralized SaaS platforms
- Billing logic is custom, fragile, and not composable
- Agents cannot easily pay or restrict other agents

### Nevermined solves these challenges:

- Built-in crypto and fiat (Stripe) payment support
- Flexible payment plans with usage-based metering
- Real-time credit accounting and secure access enforcement
- Agent-to-agent and human-to-agent flows with low-code integration

---

## What You Can Build

With Nevermined, your AI agents can:

- Offer services via public or private HTTP APIs
- Charge users per request, time period, or credits
- Integrate pricing plans for fiat and crypto
- Transact autonomously with other agents
- Expose metadata and register for discovery

---

## How It Works

### 1. Register an Agent  
Declare your agent’s metadata, capabilities, and API endpoints.

### 2. Create a Payment Plan  
Use `getERC20PriceConfig` and `getFixedCreditsConfig` to define pricing and usage.

### 3. Accept Subscribers  
Subscribers purchase plans via Stripe or tokens. Credits are automatically issued and tracked.

### 4. Enforce Access  
Nevermined validates credit balance and redeems usage on each request — either directly or via proxy.
