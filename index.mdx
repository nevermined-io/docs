Nevermined is an open payments and access protocol designed for the AI economy. It provides infrastructure for AI agents to monetize their services, transact autonomously, and integrate seamlessly with both Web2 and Web3 payment systems — all without centralized platforms or complex billing infrastructure.

## Why Nevermined?

The AI economy is growing rapidly, but monetization remains fragmented and inefficient. Most AI tools rely on centralized SaaS platforms, billing logic is custom and fragile, and agents cannot easily pay or restrict other agents. Nevermined is designed from scratch with AI Builders and Agents in mind to solve these challenges.

### Nevermined is Different

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Designed for Agents" icon="robot">
    Enable human-to-agent and autonomous agent-to-agent payment flows.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Flexible" icon="puzzle-piece">
    Create payment plans limited by time (subscriptions) or usage (credits), with support for crypto and fiat payments.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Secure" icon="shield-halved">
    No need to embed wallets into agents. The protocol validates correct usage and charging, ensuring no single party has full control.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Easy to Use" icon="power-plug">
    Integrate with low-code libraries in Python and TypeScript, a REST API, or our Web App for configuration and monitoring.

## The Nevermined Stack

Nevermined's architecture is layered to provide flexibility and power to developers. Each layer builds upon the one below it, from the blockchain foundation to the user-facing applications.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Layer 4: Applications" icon="layer-group">
    This is the top-level, user-facing layer where services are consumed. It includes any application that integrates Nevermined to find, use, or provide monetized AI services.
    
    - **Marketplaces**: Platforms for discovering and subscribing to AI agents.
    - **AI Agents**: The individual, monetizable AI services you build.
    - **AI Apps**: Applications that consume one or more AI agents.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Layer 3: Services (API & Libraries)" icon="code-branch">
     The core integration point for developers. This layer abstracts the complexity of the blockchain, providing access to all protocol features through a unified API and developer-friendly SDKs.
     
    - **Nevermined API**: The central REST API for managing agents, plans, and access.
    - **SDKs**: Libraries in TypeScript and Python for easy integration.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Layer 2: Registry & Settlement (Smart Contracts)" icon="file-contract">
     The on-chain foundation handling agent registration, payment settlement, and the enforcement of access rules. This layer includes smart contracts for:
     
    - **Agents Registry**: A directory of all registered AI agents.
    - **Payment Plans**: The logic defining the terms of service.
    - **Credits Factories (ERC-1155)**: Manages the creation and redemption of usage credits.
    - **Agreements & Conditions**: Enforces the transactional agreements between parties.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Layer 1: Blockchain Network" icon="cubes">
    The decentralized, EVM-compatible networks where Nevermined's smart contracts are deployed. This ensures that all transactions and agreements are secure, transparent, and censorship-resistant. Nevermined can run on networks like:
    
    - Ethereum
    - Polygon
    - Base
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

Nevermined integrates easily with any AI Agent orchestration framework, such as A2A, MCP, or any other custom system.
