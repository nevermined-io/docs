# AI Integration with Nevermined

## Overview

Nevermined Payments is a TypeScript-first SDK that enables AI builders to monetize their agents through a decentralized payments protocol. It's specifically designed for the AI-native economy, providing seamless integration for AI services, agent-to-agent transactions, and flexible monetization models.

## Key Features for AI Builders

### AI Agent Monetization
Register and monetize your AI services with flexible payment models tailored for AI workloads:
- **Per-request pricing**: Charge based on API calls or inference requests
- **Time-based subscriptions**: Monthly or annual access to your AI services
- **Usage-based billing**: Dynamic pricing based on compute complexity
- **Hybrid models**: Combine time and usage limits for maximum flexibility

### Agent-to-Agent Transactions
Enable autonomous AI-to-AI commerce where agents can:
- Discover and purchase services from other agents
- Automatically negotiate and execute transactions
- Build complex AI workflows with multiple paid services
- Create AI marketplaces and ecosystems

### Dual Payment Support
Accept payments in both:
- **Cryptocurrency**: ERC-20 tokens for Web3-native users
- **Fiat payments**: Traditional payments via Stripe integration
- **No wallet required**: Simplified onboarding for traditional developers

### Credit-Based Billing
Implement sophisticated usage tracking:
- **Tokenized credits**: Represent computational units or API calls
- **Dynamic credit consumption**: Adjust costs based on request complexity
- **Real-time settlement**: Instant credit redemption and balance updates
- **Usage analytics**: Track and optimize AI service consumption

## Why Nevermined for AI?

### Built for AI Workloads
- **High-frequency authorization**: Optimized for rapid API calls
- **Low latency**: Minimal overhead for real-time AI services
- **Scalable**: Handle millions of micro-transactions efficiently

### Developer-Friendly
- **TypeScript SDK**: First-class TypeScript support with full type safety
- **Simple integration**: Get started with just a few lines of code
- **Flexible deployment**: Direct integration or proxy-based setup

### Security & Trust
- **Cryptographic validation**: Secure request signatures
- **Access control**: Fine-grained permission management
- **Decentralized**: No single point of failure or control

## Common AI Use Cases

### 1. LLM Services
Monetize large language model access with per-token or per-request pricing.

### 2. Computer Vision APIs
Charge for image processing, object detection, or video analysis services.

### 3. Data Processing Pipelines
Bill for complex data transformation and analysis workflows.

### 4. AI Consulting Agents
Create specialized AI agents that charge for domain expertise.

### 5. Model Training Services
Offer compute resources for training custom AI models.

## Getting Started

To start monetizing your AI agent:

1. **Install the SDK**
   ```bash
   npm install @nevermined-io/payments
   ```

2. **Initialize the client**
   ```typescript
   import { Payments } from '@nevermined-io/payments'
   
   const payments = Payments.getInstance({
     nvmApiKey: process.env.NVM_API_KEY,
     environment: 'production'
   })
   ```

3. **Register your AI agent**
   ```typescript
   const { agentId, planId } = await payments.registerAgentAndPlan(
     agentMetadata,
     agentApi,
     priceConfig,
     creditsConfig
   )
   ```
