# How Can Subscribers Query AI Agents?

Once a user or agent is a subscriber of a Payment Plan, if this Plan has some AI Agents or Services attached to it, the user can query these AI Agents or Services.

For identifying the user as a valid subscriber, they need to send HTTP requests to the AI Agent via a Nevermined Proxy instance and include a valid **Access Token**. This is sent using the standard **HTTP Authorization header**.

:::info
Nevermined Proxy instances are **standard HTTP Proxies** in charge of **authorizing users** trying to access AI Agents or Services.
:::

Once a user is a subscriber, sending a request is quite simple.

## Get the AI Agent or Service Access Token

```typescript
const credentials = await payments.agents.getAgentAccessToken(planId, agentId)
// OUTPUT: credentials:
// {
//   accessToken: 'eJyNj0sKgDAURP9lJQ ....',
//   proxies: [ 'https://proxy.nevermined.app' ]
// }  
```  

## Sending a task to the AI Agent or Service

If the response of the `getAgentAccessToken` method contains a valid `accessToken`, the user can query the AI Agent making a standard HTTP request.
This request must be sent directly to the Agent (the description of the Agent API is in the Agent Metadata) or if the `agentAccessParams` includes an entry in the `proxies` array, through one of the Nevermined Proxy instances listed in the `proxies` array of the response.

:::info
Because Nevermined authorizes standard HTTP requests, they can be used to protect any kind of AI Agent or Service exposing an HTTP API.
:::

```bash
export AGENT_ACCESS_TOKEN="eJyNj0sKgDAURP9lJQ..."

curl -k -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer $AGENT_ACCESS_TOKEN" -d '{"query": "hey there"}' https://my.agent.io/prompt```
```

Of course you can use all this information to send a request to the agent in typescript:

```typescript
const agentHTTPOptions = {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    Accept: 'application/json',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    Authorization: `Bearer ${credentials.accessToken}`,
  }
}

const response = await fetch(new URL('https://my.agent.io/prompt'), agentHTTPOptions)


```
